* **Bay to Bay x AE.STUDIO**: AE Studio partnered with Bay to Bay Financial to revolutionize lead distribution in the financial advisory sector. We developed an automated lead distribution system that seamlessly connects potential clients with financial advisors. The platform features a user-friendly landing page for appointment booking and a gated dashboard for advisors to manage leads. Key features include Google Authentication for streamlined agent registration, customizable lead thresholds, and a flexible credit system accommodating various agent types.
* **Grow Credit x AE.STUDIO**: Grow Credit enlisted AE Studio to tackle the data science challenge of assessing creditworthiness with minimal information. Our team developed a sophisticated machine learning model using XGBoost that analyzes only the customer's name, address, bank information, and 60 days of account history to predict loan default risk, circumventing the need for traditional credit data.

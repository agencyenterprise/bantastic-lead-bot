Pixel War is a web3 RPG battle game with Hero and Item NFTs. Players can configure and boost their heroes for combat prowess, rarity and aesthetic value. Everything in the Pixel Universe is tracked on the blockchain, and limited (think CCG - collectible card games like Pokemon and Magic: The Gathering). New items can be earned or purchased via a pack-like system, and traded on secondary marketplaces.

Composable NFTâ€™s
Every hero is unique composable NFT combining a fantasy race, class, aspect, special abilities and attributes. Players can exchange and swap items to customize their NFT characters.

Leaderboards
Heroes can battle in ranked matches and skirmishes. The best players can rise to the top of the leaderboard enticing everyone to continue competing.

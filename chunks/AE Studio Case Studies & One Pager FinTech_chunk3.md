* **IncomeMax x AE.STUDIO**: AE Studio's collaboration with UK-based social enterprise IncomeMax highlights a significant step towards using AI and LLMs in humane ways—in this case, by directly empowering financially vulnerable families. We developed “Max”, a friendly AI chatbot that supports the IncomeMax advisors who help people struggling with their finances. Max streamlines the information-gathering process so agents more effectively support customer needs.

### Open-Source Neurotech Initiatives:
AE Studio has developed and released key open-source tools to accelerate BCI and neuroscience work. For instance, their Neurotech Development Kit provides building blocks for BCI prototyping (Developing a BCI Operating System), and theyâ€™ve contributed to popular neurodata analysis libraries (serving on the steering committee of projects like MNE) (Developing a BCI Operating System). In collaboration with neuroengineers, they built neural data simulators that allow researchers to test BCI algorithms in realistic conditions without hardware (Developing a BCI Operating System). Additionally, AE has driven the adoption of standards like BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) for organizing neural data, enabling easier data sharing across labs (Developing a BCI Operating System). These contributions significantly lower barriers for others in the industry and have been recognized by the community.

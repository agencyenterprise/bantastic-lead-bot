### How do I know this custom AI solution wonâ€™t be replaced / commoditized / outdated in 3-6 months because the AI field is moving so quickly?
Addressing Client Hesitation 
* Build solutions in a modular way to easily integrate improved technology when it becomes available.
* Being first to market and establishing a user base provides competitive advantage.
* Commoditized versions rarely align perfectly with specific business needs.

Business Value Arguments 
* Having a working solution that generates ROI now is better than waiting for future technology.
* Calculate the advantage of having a solution 3-6 months earlier versus waiting.
* The opportunity cost of delaying AI integration is too high to justify waiting.

## Notable Projects and Developments:

### Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB) Challenge Champion:
AE’s data science team won first place in the inaugural international NLB competition, topping the leaderboard in every category (Developing a BCI Operating System). This challenge tested machine learning models on neural datasets, and AE’s victory showcased their technical leadership in BCI signal decoding (Developing a BCI Operating System). They reinvested the prize money to sponsor Phase II of the NLB Challenge and even offered cloud computing grants to all participating teams, spurring further innovation in the field (Developing a BCI Operating System). (Their winning solution was open-sourced for the community (Developing a BCI Operating System).)

### Internal Initiatives (Skunkworks & Grants):
AE reinvests in innovation through internal “Skunkworks” projects and an AE Grants program. They fund and develop high-risk, high-reward ideas in BCI and AI that might not get support elsewhere (Developing a BCI Operating System) (AE Studio | Research Grants). The AE Grants initiative provides financial aid, engineering support, and resources to researchers building public-good neurotechnology (like open-source tools or datasets) (AE Studio | Research Grants). By backing altruistic BCI projects and running in-house experiments, AE Studio continually explores new frontiers – from novel BCI applications to approaches for aligning AI with human values (“neglected approaches” in their alignment agenda) – further cementing their leadership in the neurotech space.

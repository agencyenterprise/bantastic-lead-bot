Protocol Labs is an open-source research, development, and deployment laboratory working on projects including IPFS, Filecoin, and libp2p. We've worked with Protocol Labs building open source tools and helping with testing and optimizations of various projects. Some things we've worked on with PL include building a network inspector style debugging tool for the Kademlia DHT implementation of go-libp2p, creating a network visualization and debugging tool using WebGL for Filecoin capable of visualizing large portions of the chain and ensuring consensus was happening as expected, and working on testing and optimizations for libp2p's gossip sub protocol in preparation for its integration into ETH 2.0.

* The key to effective objection handling is actively seeking out concerns rather than avoiding them. [cite: 80]
* **Core Principles:**
    * Actively hunt for objections - don't wait for them to surface. [cite: 80]
    * Ask follow-up questions to understand the real concern. [cite: 80]
    * Make the prospect feel heard and understood. [cite: 80]
    * Address concerns directly to create safety. [cite: 80]
    * Better to handle objections in the open than let them remain unspoken. [cite: 80]
* **Examples:**
    * **Scenario 1 - Need Partner Approval:** Client: "I need to talk to my partner first." [cite: 81]
        * **Strong Response:** "I completely understand. How about this - even though you're not sure yet, let's put something on the calendar as tentative. You can always decline it, and I'll assume you won't accept unless I hear otherwise. But if you do get that approval, we'll already have the time secured. Does that sound fair?" [cite: 82]

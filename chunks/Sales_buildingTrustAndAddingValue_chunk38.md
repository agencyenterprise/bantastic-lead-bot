## 7. Objection Handling

* Always think about potential objections (before the call). [cite: 78] Have levers to pull, and be ready to pull them when you need them. [cite: 78] This could be in the form of different proposals/projects, changing rates (have it pre-approved and thought off), consulting proposals, etcâ€¦ [cite: 78] That way, you handle objections head-on and don't extend the sale cycle unnecessarily. [cite: 78]

### A. Budget Objections

* **If the prospect says it's not in budget:** [cite: 79]
    * Ask: "What is your budget?" [cite: 79]
    * **If they provide a number:** [cite: 79]
        * Confirm if they would proceed at that budget. [cite: 79]
        * Adjust scope to match budget if possible. [cite: 79]
    * **If they don't know their budget:** [cite: 79]
        * Consider it a red flag. [cite: 79]
        * Be direct about time investment. [cite: 79]
        * Consider pausing engagement until they have clarity. [cite: 79]

### Client Discovery (10-15 minutes)
What to say: "Now we'd love to hear more about [Client Company]. What are you working on currently? What challenges are you facing that led you to this conversation? What are your goals for this potential partnership?" 
Why it works: Puts the focus on the client early, showing you're interested in understanding their needs before pitching your services.
*Give client ample time to explain their business, challenges, and goals - this should be the longest single segment of the call* 

This is a good time to BANT.

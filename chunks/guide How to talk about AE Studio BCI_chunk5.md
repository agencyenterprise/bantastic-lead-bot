### User Experience and Product Design:
Emphasizing UX in neurotech â€“ AE Studio recognizes that even advanced BCI or neuroscience tools need excellent user interfaces to succeed. They develop companion apps and intuitive user workflows for neurotechnology products (Neurotechnology Consulting), applying their web and mobile development skillset to create engaging, accessible experiences for end-users (patients, clinicians, or consumers). By integrating user research and design early, they ensure neuroscience innovations are practical and user-friendly, not just technically sound (Neurotechnology Consulting).

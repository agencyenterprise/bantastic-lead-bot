* We won a best paper award at NeurIPS for our paper Ignore Previous Prompt: Attack Techniques for Language Models (now referenced over 100 times by the AI community). 
* We’ve worked with Electronic Arts to set up appropriate evaluation frameworks for tracking and optimization of their internal LLM systems. 
* We have been technology partners to Protocol Labs (developers of IPFS, Filecoin, etc) for many years leading projects including debugging tools for Filecoin ahead of mainnet launch, testing and optimizations for libp2p's gossip sub protocol in preparation for its integration into ETH 2.0, writing developer documentation, and development of the Emissary platform which has processed ~25M FIL (~$200M USD) and is growing at ~20% MoM.  We’re currently in the process of open sourcing it, so will be able to share that code soon!

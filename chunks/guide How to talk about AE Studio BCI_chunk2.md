## Key Areas of Work:

### Neurotechnology Applications in Healthcare:
Developing BCIs and neurotech for medical use-cases – current BCI technology is already used to restore hearing (cochlear implants), enable paralyzed patients to control limbs, and treat neurological disorders like Parkinson’s (Developing a BCI Operating System). AE Studio contributes to these life-improving applications (e.g. BCIs to help patients walk, talk, see, or hear again) through its collaborations and projects (Neurotechnology Consulting).

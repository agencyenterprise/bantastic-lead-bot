## 2. Sales Psychology

### A. Emotional Components

* Sales is an emotional game, not just logical. [cite: 3]
* **Decision-makers face emotional risks:**
    * A 6-figure investment carries career risk for non-C-level executives. [cite: 3]
    * A bad project presents an important opportunity cost risk for C-level executives. [cite: 3]
    * Acknowledge and empathize with that risk. [cite: 3]
* Make them believe that you are not going to screw them over; most people suck, we don't. [cite: 4]
* **Conviction in presentation is crucial:**
    * Believe in your product/service. [cite: 5]
    * Show genuine confidence in your capabilities. [cite: 5]
    * Emotional conviction drives sales more than technical details. [cite: 5]

* **Objection Detection:**
    * Listen and observe for early signs of potential objections. [cite: 132]
    * Note down specific concerns for later addressing. [cite: 132]
    * Or try to already add a question to slack for the lead to raise, the earlier the better. [cite: 133]
    * Be prepared to provide additional context or examples that support the lead's points, increasing depth will definitely help increase trust on the approach, on the examples and on the overall team. [cite: 134]
* **Emotional Connection:**
    * While the lead discusses technical solutions, the support can maintain the human element whenever appropriate. [cite: 135]
    * This could play really well if we had something from the intro call, or even if the person talking about tech is the support role and the lead can pull back something to connect with the rapport work done on previous calls. [cite: 136]

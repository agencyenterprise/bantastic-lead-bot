### What percentage of your company is in Brazil vs USA vs other places?
50% / 50% Brazil and USA with a smattering of folks around the rest of the world.

### High level estimates for AE?
(We can always deflect this if we don't want to share).

Minimum project size of $150k with a 6-8 week start date after receipt of retainer.

If they complain about timeline or capacity objections:
* Frame being at capacity as a positive - "we have more demand than supply because we're best in class".
* Create urgency with FIFO (first in, first out) principle - delays without deposit could push start dates further.
* Strategy pre-defined with allocations info: Use Sprint Zero (discovery phase) to buy time - start discovery 2-3 weeks out while waiting for full team availability.

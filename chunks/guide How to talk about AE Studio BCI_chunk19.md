### Enhancing Human Capabilities:
All of AE Studio’s neuroscience ventures center on the goal of improving human capabilities or health – thereby expanding the market for “human augmentation” and neuro-restorative technologies. By demonstrating tangible successes (like BCI-driven limb control or better stroke diagnostics), they help validate the BCI/neurotech sector to investors, healthcare providers, and end-users. Each successful project builds confidence that neurotechnology can solve important problems, potentially attracting more funding and talent into the field. AE often highlights that neurotechnology remains a neglected opportunity relative to its potential (Developing a BCI Operating System), and their work aims to change that by showcasing impactful use cases and maintaining neuroethical standards as the field grows (Developing a BCI Operating System).

### Innovation via Skunkworks and Grants:
Internally, AE will continue to fund “skunkworks” passion projects and grant initiatives to explore frontier ideas in neuroscience and AI. This could lead to new spin-off ventures or open-source breakthroughs. Their grant program will persist in supporting external researchers focused on public-good neurotech and responsible AI (AE Studio | Research Grants), seeding the development of novel tools or data sets that align with AE’s vision. By nurturing this ecosystem of innovators, AE Studio ensures a pipeline of fresh concepts – from novel neural interfaces to ethical AI integration with the brain – that it can help bring to fruition.

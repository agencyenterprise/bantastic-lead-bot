* **Example 3 - Combined Approach (Use this one!):** "That's completely understandable. Many firms we work with are exploring AI for the first time, trying to understand both the possibilities and the investment required. Let me be transparent - our typical projects are in the six figures because we provide comprehensive, enterprise-grade solutions. Before we dive deeper, I want to make sure that's within the realm of possibility for your business. If it's not, we should probably pause here to respect your time. If it is, we can explore different approaches and work together to align on the right scope and investment level. Would a six-figure investment be something you could consider?" [cite: 38]

* When someone gives a price objection, there are typically two reasons: 1) They don't see the value, or 2) They don't have the budget. [cite: 146]
* When handling objections, use a curious, understanding tone. [cite: 147] Restate their objection to confirm you understand, then dig deeper to uncover the root cause. [cite: 147]
* Provide a range or estimate rather than a single fixed price. [cite: 148] This allows flexibility and shows you're being transparent. [cite: 148]
* Quantify the value and ROI upfront. [cite: 149] Tie the investment to the potential cost savings or revenue increase. [cite: 149]
* Use concrete numbers and ranges. [cite: 149]
* If they push back on price, don't immediately offer a discount. [cite: 150] Instead, explain why the value justifies the investment, or offer a payment plan at a slightly higher price. [cite: 151]
* Be prepared to walk away if they are solely focused on price and unwilling to see the value you provide. [cite: 152]

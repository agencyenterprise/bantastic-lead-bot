### How to deal with client expectations when we have tight allocations:

* **Strategic Capacity Communication:**
    * Position scarcity as evidence of quality and market validation: "We're super proud that we are one of the most premier AI vendors on the marketplace, which is why we get a lot of referrals." [cite: 160]
    * Use specific language about availability: "Based on our current capacity forecast, we only have availability to bring on one more client and the tentative onboarding date is [date]." [cite: 161]
    * Create transparent urgency: "We are in conversation with X other firms. Whoever completes the retainer first will secure that open spot." [cite: 161]
    * Reinforce quality standards: "If we're going to sustain our quality standards, we do not compromise our capacity plan, which is why we're so good at delivering." [cite: 161]

* **Client Example:** "When it comes to medicaldata.com, it's just one of those things. I'm not a tech guy. I built this, my father built this company 20 years ago and I've been working through it. And I kind of know, I know all our vendors and all our partners. And I just know we have so much data that there are, there's so many use cases. There's governmental use cases. There are use cases for PE firms and our clients. And it's just one of those things we don't, we have data analysts, but it takes them a while and it's pretty costly. From what I've seen with AI, I would imagine that there's an opportunity here. And I don't even know what the opportunity is, I just know there is. So I'm a second generation CEO trying to make my name for myself. And I also, I think this is the opportunity." [cite: 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]

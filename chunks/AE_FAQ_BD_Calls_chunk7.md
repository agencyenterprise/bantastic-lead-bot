Second, we include buffer time in our planning. We know from experience that technical projects often encounter unexpected challenges. Our team's PhDs and senior engineers have developed a methodology where we estimate the work, then add 20-40% padding based on the project's complexity. This approach has helped us maintain a strong track record of delivering within our estimated ranges for our clients. 
Third, we maintain complete transparency throughout the product development process. You'll receive weekly demos showing exactly what we've built, allowing us to course-correct early if needed rather than surprising you several weeks into the project. 
If you're concerned about estimates specifically, I'm curious - have you had negative experiences with vendors missing deadlines or exceeding budgets in the past?"

### How would you guys scale up if we needed to go into 10 projects?
We will work with you to scope out the new projects, provide accurate estimates, write up proposals, and allocate new teams to work on those projects.

Importantly:
* Plant the seed that growth is possible but must be planned.
* Treat each new department as a new account with its own timeline.
* Emphasize that waiting for premium service is worth the opportunity cost.

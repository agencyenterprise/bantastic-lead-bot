* Engaged in several development and data science projects for Biocentury, including a seamless relaunch of their platform using modern technology after migrating 27 years of content from a legacy system and an initiative to automate data entry of drug pipelines which reduced the need for manual labor that would have otherwise cost Biocentury many millions of dollars over the next few years.
* Worked collaboratively with the neuroscience community to develop standards and secure methods of analyzing neural data and to train and evaluate privacy-preserving machine learning models.
* Developed MVPs and beyond for dozens of startups. Some fun ones include Best Apps where we acted as their entire tech team developing a platform and apps to allow for fans to collaborate with brands to create custom apparel. Their main app had over 300k downloads with millions of visits per day during major launches with A-list celebs like Arianna Grande and Justin Bieber.

### Implementation Notes:
* **Adapt to the conversation flow** - This is a guide, not a rigid script.
* Be ready to adjust based on how the client responds.
* **Listen actively** - Notice how in the transcripts, AE employees ask questions and listen before diving into capabilities.
* **Match energy levels** - Some clients are formal, others casual. Match their communication style.
* **Be prepared with examples** - Have 2-3 relevant case studies ready based on the client's industry or challenge.
* **Address objections proactively** - If you sense hesitation about pricing or approach, address it directly.
* **Follow up promptly** - Send a follow-up email with any promised materials within 24 hours.
* **Be authentic** - The most successful AE introductions show genuine enthusiasm for solving the client's problems.

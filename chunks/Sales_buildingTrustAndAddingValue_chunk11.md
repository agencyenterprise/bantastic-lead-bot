### Bonus: Intervening Strategically with ‘Talkative’ Clients (i.e. they won't shut up)

* Lead with apologetic humility: "I'm so sorry and I apologize for cutting you off. Do you mind if I raise something real quick?" [cite: 13]
* Frame interventions as serving the client's interests: "To make sure we respect your time and address all key topics." [cite: 13]
* Use the concept of "rabbit holes" metaphorically: "We're going down this rabbit hole. We can either continue this path or go this other path. Which would you prefer?" [cite: 14, 15]
* Set clear expectations at call start: "Our plan today is to cover X, Y, Z with the goal of getting you a concrete plan by the end." [cite: 15]

### How are we staying on top of AI? How do we pass on those learnings and efficiencies to clients?
Every time a new AI technology comes out, our same-day skunkworks team develops and deploys a product using that technology within 24-48 hours.
You can learn more about our same-day skunkworks projects here ([https://ae.studio/same-day-skunkworks](https://ae.studio/same-day-skunkworks)).
Our same-day skunkworks team shares their learnings internally via documented reports and weekly internal demos.

We share our learnings and efficiencies with clients via:
* Our AE Studio Bytes newsletter ([https://aestudio.beehiiv.com/](https://aestudio.beehiiv.com/)) 
* Adopting the latest AI technology into our ongoing projects ASAP 
* Sharing our experiences and recommendations with clients via our shared slack channel, daily standups, and weekly demos

### Forest Neurotech Partnership:
AE Studio supports Forest Neurotech, a startup developing a minimally invasive ultrasonic whole-brain interface, with data science and software development services (Neurotechnology Consulting). Forest’s goal of an ultrasound-based BCI (which can influence or read brain activity without major surgery) aligns with AE’s mission to empower individuals and improve lives through neurotech. By contributing engineering talent to Forest’s platform, AE helps accelerate this novel approach to brain-computer interfacing.

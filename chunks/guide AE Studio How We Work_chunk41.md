here are some sample options weâ€™ve done in the past for maintenance post project development:

* **reduced feature development team** - work with a reduced number of developers or data scientists than the full team, to continue making progress on features while also conducting maintenance, bug fixes, and adjustments.
* **dedicated maintenance skeleton crew** - 1 half-time developer or data scientist allocated - with this, we can guarantee prompt responses and turnaround to reported bugs and issues.
* **on-demand maintenance skeleton crew** - We will be attentive to feature requests and reported bugs - while this won't have the same guaranteed response time as the options above, we aim to respond to requests as soon as possible.
* if any bugs or requests are estimated to be a significant amount of work, we will let you know for approval before working on it.
* Please note that this on-demand plan has a higher rate than the options with dedicated allocation.

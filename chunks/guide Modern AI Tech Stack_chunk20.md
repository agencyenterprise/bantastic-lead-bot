    * **Perplexica:** A self-hosted alternative that combines open-source LLMs through Ollama. Provides multiple search modes and local file search capabilities while maintaining privacy.

    * Quality vs. quantity of results.
    * Privacy and data handling requirements.
    * Need for customization and self-hosting.
* These tools can be particularly valuable when building autonomous agents or research-intensive applications that require real-time information retrieval capabilities.

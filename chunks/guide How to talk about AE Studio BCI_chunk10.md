### Blackrock Neurotech “MoveAgain” Collaboration:
AE Studio is partnering with Blackrock Neurotech on the development of MoveAgain, the first commercial BCI platform aimed at restoring movement for people with paralysis (Neurotechnology Consulting). Blackrock is known for its implantable electrode technology that has enabled BCI pioneers to regain abilities like walking, speaking, and feeling touch (Neurotechnology Consulting). AE Studio supports MoveAgain by advancing its training and calibration software (per a 2022 announcement), bringing its data science and product development expertise to improve patient outcomes. This collaboration exemplifies AE’s role in translating cutting-edge BCI research into real-world clinical solutions for spinal cord injury patients.

* **Strategic Listening and Note-Taking:**
    * Capture both explicit and implicit needs while the lead focuses on staying present and engaged in discussion. [cite: 115]
    * Taking detailed notes, especially about pain points, priorities, and technical requirements. [cite: 116]
    * Pay special attention to personal anecdotes and emotional cues from the prospect. [cite: 117] Observe client reactions, body language, and tone. [cite: 117]
    * Are they hesitant about something? Excited about a particular feature? This subtle insight can inform the proposal. [cite: 118]
    * Document specific phrases and terminology the client uses (to mirror in the proposal). [cite: 119]
    * Make clear notes on these so the team doesn't need to rewatch the call or waste time in it. [cite: 120]
    * Also in ways that we could leverage LLMs to ingest these insights into the context to support the team when it's used. [cite: 121]

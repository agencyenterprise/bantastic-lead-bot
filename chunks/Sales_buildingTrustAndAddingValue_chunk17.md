* **Client:** "I'm not sure about budget, I've never explored this." [cite: 30]
* **Example 1 - Exploratory Approach:** "That's completely understandable. Many of the firms we work with are exploring AI for the first time. We work with PE firms and VC firms regularly who are looking at these new business models, and there are many different forms this can take. Let's first align on the right approach, and then we can work together on the budget." [cite: 31, 32, 33]
* **Example 2 - Direct Qualification:** "I appreciate your transparency. Let me be upfront - our typical projects are in the six figures. Before we invest more time on both sides, I want to make sure that a six-figure investment would be within range for your business. If it's not, we should probably pause here so we don't waste your valuable time. Would a six-figure investment be something you could consider?" [cite: 34, 35, 36, 37]

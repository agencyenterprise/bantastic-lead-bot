### Allocations

Projects have a core team allocation which may scale up or down when necessary. We typically stick to relatively consistent full or half time allocations for the core team as this is generally aligned with what is most efficient in terms of team member productivity and reducing management costs. You can strategize with your program director about what allocation size and composition may be most appropriate for your current needs. We allocate projects based on what people would be best suited given the needs of the project, so exact team composition may change over time as the needs of the project evolve. The team working on your project are all AE team members who are hand selected and internally developed for their skills and professionalism, but they are also real people who may get sick, take a vacation, or have a family emergency. We have processes in place to provide coverage for these events to ensure the success of your project is not impacted.

# Sales: Building Trust and Adding Value

## 1. Core Philosophy and Conviction

* **Matching Body Language:** Confidence is key; would you buy from someone unsure of themselves? [cite: 1]
* **Always be serving (instead of always be selling):** Always think about value; technical stuff is irrelevant if it does not bring value. [cite: 2] Be obsessed about value, for example, "we only work on projects that bring companies at least 6 figures of ROI." [cite: 2]
* **Make it obvious that we are the best option.** [cite: 2]
* **Don't make the sales process longer or harder than it needs to be:** make it easy for people to buy. [cite: 3]

* **Building Trust Through Scarcity:**
    * Use client extension narrative: "Most of our clients extend their projects because we drive tremendous value." [cite: 161]
    * Explain scheduling constraints positively: "This allows us to find the perfect resource fit for your project." [cite: 162]
    * Provide specific timelines: "The next availability after that is 4-6 weeks depending on how things shake out." [cite: 162]
    * Always end with consent-building: "Is that okay with you?" [cite: 162]

### StrokeDx Project:
AE Studio is working with StrokeDX, a company transforming how strokes are diagnosed, on their software and analytics platform (Neurotechnology Consulting). StrokeDX’s technology uses brain blood-flow data to rapidly identify regions with abnormal perfusion (too much or too little blood), guiding doctors in urgent stroke treatment decisions (Neurotechnology Consulting). AE’s engineers are building the platform that interprets and visualizes this neural blood-flow information, highlighting the firm’s expansion of neurotech into diagnostic and monitoring tools.

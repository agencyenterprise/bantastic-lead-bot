### Open-Source Tools and Standards:
Contributing to the broader neurotech community through open-source software and data standards. AE Studio has released the Neurotech Development Kit â€“ an open-source toolkit aimed at lowering the barrier to entry for BCI entrepreneurs and researchers (Developing a BCI Operating System). They have also co-created neural data simulators (in partnership with leading BCI scientists like Dr. Chadwick Boulay) to accelerate development and testing of BCI systems (Developing a BCI Operating System). Moreover, the team actively works on establishing and supporting open data standards (such as the BIDS format for brain data) to enable sharing and reuse of neuroscience data (Developing a BCI Operating System). By sitting on the steering councils of major open-source neuro-analysis projects and contributing code, AE Studio helps ensure the entire industry can build on common, validated tools (Developing a BCI Operating System).

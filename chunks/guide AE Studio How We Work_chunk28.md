amazing job. Your program director has deep experience working across many different companies to not only ensure that specific engagements are successful, but also providing strategic guidance and support, so please use them as a resource and share everything and anything with them. They will have a regularly scheduled weekly 30 minute call with you (which is not billed for) and are also available to you whenever needed and will also run strategic meetings such as kickoff, internal project check ins, and beyond the horizons meetings.

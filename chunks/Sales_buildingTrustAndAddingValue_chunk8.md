* **Position yourself as an advocate:**
    * "Let us be your advocates in this conversation." [cite: 8]
    * "We're here to help you champion this internally." [cite: 8]
* **Show you're on their side:**
    * Share relevant experiences: "We're bootstrapped too, we understand these decisions." [cite: 9]
    * Acknowledge their constraints: "We totally get it - these are big decisions." [cite: 9]

### Agenda Setting
What to say: "For our call today, I'd like to propose a simple agenda: we'll start with brief introductions from our team, then we'd love to hear about your business and challenges. After that, we'll share a bit about AE Studio and explore how we might be able to help. Finally, we'll discuss potential next steps. Does that sound good to you?" 
Why it works: Creates structure and sets expectations for the conversation while giving the client a chance to modify the agenda if needed.
*Pause for client confirmation* 

### Team Introductions
What to say: "Let me quickly introduce our team here today..." [Each team member gives a 30-second intro with name, role, and relevant background/expertise] 

Why it works: Demonstrates the depth of expertise on the call and shows you've brought the right people to address their needs.

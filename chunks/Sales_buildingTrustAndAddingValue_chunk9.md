### F. Example Demonstrations

* **Personal Connection Example:** "That's so cool that you're in a family business. I know the statistics - about 50% fail from first to second generation, and 80-90% fail by the third generation. So what you've achieved is really remarkable." [cite: 10, 11]
* **Building Trust Example:** "I have a great relationship with my dad but never worked with him - I can imagine that must be really fulfilling" or "I never had a great relationship with my dad, so I really admire that you've made that work." [cite: 11]
* **Market Urgency Example:** "There's a small window - two to three years right now - where the people getting to market first are going to reap massive benefits by being early adopters. Even though you don't know exactly what the answer is, you're doing the right thing by exploring." [cite: 12]

### Real-Time BCI Systems & Signal Processing:
Building real-time neurofeedback, neurostimulation, and neurodiagnostic systems. AE Studio leverages expertise spanning audio engineering, robotics, physics, and more to develop low-latency, reliable BCI applications (Neurotechnology Consulting). They have designed signal processing pipelines for a wide range of neural signals (from intracortical electrodes to EEG/ECoG, fNIRS, EMG, etc.), optimizing these systems for everything from embedded devices to cloud platforms (Neurotechnology Consulting). This know-how ensures they can meet strict performance requirements (latency, accuracy, etc.) for interactive brain-controlled technologies (Neurotechnology Consulting).

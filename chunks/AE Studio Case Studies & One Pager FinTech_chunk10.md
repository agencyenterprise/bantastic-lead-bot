* We won first place in the Neural Latent Benchmark Challenge, a competition in the BCI community that applies machine learning to neural signals.
* We have open-sourced our solution and funded the second round of the competition as a means to propel the BCI field forward.
* We open-sourced a state-of-the-art AI model for decoding imagined handwriting from brain signals and for delivering high-performance brain-to-text communication.
* We worked closely with EVgo, the largest charging network in America to spearhead many of their initiatives ranging from mobile app rollout to internal tools to the successful launch of the eXtend product which resulted in a double digit percentage increases in their stock price.
* We won a best paper award at NeurIPS for our paper Ignore Previous Prompt: Attack Techniques for Language Models (now referenced over 100 times by the AI community).

## 13. The Support Role

* Be the second pair of eyes for the lead strategist. [cite: 112]
* Make sure to give confidence for the lead to focus on the prospect by being focused on all the details listed below as much as possible, keeping a quick and effective communication line on slack without spamming the chat, so the lead doesn't lose focus on the call by reading tons of text that might not help the deal move forward. [cite: 113]
* The support role should be armed with all tools possible to provide the best context support and strategic note-taking on the call. [cite: 114]
* This means smart usage of slack, perplexity, Claude prospect project, a note-taking app, sales documents, etc. [cite: 114]

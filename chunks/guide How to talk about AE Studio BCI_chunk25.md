### Continued Market Impact:
In terms of business trajectory, AE Studio is likely to remain a key player in the BCI startup space – both as a development partner and as an investor through its venture arm. We might see AE launching or backing new startups that emerge from its incubator programs (akin to how it supported companies like Forest Neurotech or StrokeDX). With BCI tech on the cusp of broader adoption, AE’s experience positions them to lead in creating the software backbone for new commercial BCI offerings. In summary, expect AE Studio to drive more collaborative BCI breakthroughs, set benchmarks for neurotech product development, and help shape a future where brain-computer interfaces are widely used to improve lives, all while keeping humanity and agency at the center of innovation.

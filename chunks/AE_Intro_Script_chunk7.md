### Process and Pricing Transparency
What to say: "Our process typically starts with an intro call like this, followed by a solutions design workshop where we dig deeper into your needs. After that, we develop a proposal with our recommendations. We work iteratively and fast-paced, often delivering an MVP within a couple of months. 

In terms of investment, our minimum engagements typically start around $150K, with market-ready MVPs often in the $250K+ range. We charge on a time and materials basis, which gives us flexibility to pivot as needed. We're transparent about this upfront because we want to make sure we're aligned on expectations." 

Why it works: Sets clear expectations about process and pricing, qualifying prospects and ensuring time isn't wasted on misaligned projects.
*Pause for client reaction to pricing and process information* 

If you havenâ€™t already touched on Budget with the client, this is a good time to see how they react.

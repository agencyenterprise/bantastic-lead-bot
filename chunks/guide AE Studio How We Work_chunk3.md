* **high transparency** about what is being done each and every day through daily standups and visibility on our project management tools.
* **regular meetings** to detail and prioritize features.
* **weekly demos and regular releases** to encourage early testing and feedback.
* **open and early discussions** about potential risks or suggested changes (something fun we do around this is a Pre Post Mortem during the kickoff process… this exercise allows us to think ‘what went wrong’ before we even start the project to make sure we’re thinking about these things as we build).
* **highly skilled team members** with a founder level mentality towards the projects they work on.
* **tech directors** to provide an outside perspective on the project, collaborate on key decisions, and ensure the project team is delivering high quality work.

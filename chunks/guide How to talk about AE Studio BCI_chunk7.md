### Neuroscience Research & Neuroethics:
AE Studio’s work sits at the intersection of practical engineering and neuroscience research. They assist in designing scientifically robust experiments and analyses for neurotech R&D, following an agile, iterative approach to quickly test and validate ideas (Neurotechnology Consulting). The company also champions neuroethical principles – believing BCI should ultimately enhance user agency. They advocate for privacy, security, and user consent in neurotechnology design (Neurotechnology Consulting). (For example, AE won a Best Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022 for developing secure methods of neural data analysis (Neurotechnology Consulting).) This focus on standards, privacy, and long-term human-centric design is woven through their projects to ensure neurotechnology improves the human condition while avoiding potential harms (Neurotechnology Consulting) (Developing a BCI Operating System).

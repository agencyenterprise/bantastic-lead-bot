AE's designers continued with development of advanced features including KDA swapping and price statistics. Additionally, we developed the MetaMask Snaps functionality that allows users to both send and receive Kadena directly into MetaMask wallets.

The successful expansion of wallet support made Kadena more accessible and user-friendly. We're honored to have been a critical part of the journey with the Kadena team.

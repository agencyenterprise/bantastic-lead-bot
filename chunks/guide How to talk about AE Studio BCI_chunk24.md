### Ethical Leadership & Neuroethical Frameworks:
As BCI technology evolves, AE Studio is poised to be a vocal advocate for neuroethics and user agency. Future initiatives will likely see AE articulate guiding principles or frameworks for “agency-increasing” BCI design, to influence how products are built industry-wide. They have stated that BCI should not follow the path of invasive ads or exploitative design (drawing analogies to “dark patterns” in current tech) (Developing a BCI Operating System). Going forward, AE may work on standards for consent and data protection in brain data, contribute to policy discussions, or develop technical methods to safeguard users’ cognitive privacy. Ensuring that the next generation of neurotech empowers users (and doesn’t inadvertently diminish human autonomy) will remain a core tenet of their projects.

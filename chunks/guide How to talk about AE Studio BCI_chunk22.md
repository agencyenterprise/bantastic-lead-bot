### Expanding Collaborations and Ecosystem:
AE Studio is actively inviting new partnerships with academia and industry to push the boundaries of neurotech. They encourage academic researchers to work with them on improving neural decoding algorithms or building real-time brain signal decoders, offering support to translate research into working prototypes (Developing a BCI Operating System). Similarly, AE seeks to onboard BCI hardware companies as early adopters of its advanced decoding and analysis tech (Developing a BCI Operating System)  – implying that AE’s internal platforms for brain-signal processing will interface with a variety of devices. In coming years, we’re likely to see AE Studio collaborate on more clinical trials, integrate with new brain-sensing hardware, and co-develop solutions in areas like non-invasive BCI, cognitive enhancement, or even brain-controlled consumer applications.

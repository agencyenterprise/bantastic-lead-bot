## How we can help you:

We do full end-to-end product development, from early MVP to millions of users or special projects within larger tech ecosystems.  We can be your whole tech team or work alongside your team.  We prefer long term partnerships where we work together for years continuing to support you, but can also do independent initiatives and hand off to internal or other teams.  We have expertise in basically anything you would need to execute on a tech project - AI, Blockchain, Product Design, Software Development, Branding, Product Management, etc. in spaces ranging from BCI to fashion.  Except hardware, we’ll work with it but we aren’t going to be making any physical devices out of our Abbot Kinney office for you.  We can work in nearly all modern languages and frameworks.  We’re not dogmatic, we pick the right tool for the job.

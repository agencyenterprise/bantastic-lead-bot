## Who you’ll work with:

* Smart competent people who don’t have huge egos 
* People who went to fancy colleges, people who dropped out of them, ex FANG, ex YC, people who didn’t have fancy names on their resume but are the smartest people you’ll ever meet, math geeks, hip designers - people of all different backgrounds who are just phenomenal at their jobs 
* Projects are assigned a core team who are full time, thinking about your project in the shower - some combination of PM, designers, developers, and data scientists (depending on the project) plus have the support of company leadership and the wider organization 

## What we don’t do / aren’t:

* A cheap ‘outsource’ option 
* Small engagements under 50k - we put a ton of effort into every one of our engagements so smaller projects just don’t work with our model

## Why do we bother with all of this?

Our vision is to **increase human agency**.

We believe that technology should increase rather than decrease human agency. We are optimistic about the future and believe in the enormous potential of technology to improve human existence, but also believe that there are great risks to human agency if we donâ€™t proactively ensure that technology is developed in an agency increasing way. We not only aim to build agency increasing products with our clients, but use our profits to fund internal R&D efforts to advance the fields of BCI and AI Alignment. We are proud to have made significant advances in these fields by focusing on neglected areas and bringing a unique approach. To complement these long term initiatives, we also donate to highly effective charities which have near-immediate impacts. By choosing to work with AE, you are helping to save children from malaria and prevent the AI apocalypse. We also type really fast.

### D. Humble Leadership Communication

* Lead with permission-asking: "Do you mind if I...?" [cite: 12]
* Use "we" language to build team perception: "We've been talking about this..." [cite: 12]
* Root all redirection in rapport-building: "I appreciate what you're sharing and want to make sure we address your core needs." [cite: 12]
* When pushing back or redirecting, do so with warmth and humility. [cite: 12]
* Keep the focus on mutual goals: "To make sure we're using our time effectively..." [cite: 12]

### E. Securing Decision Maker Involvement

* **Get commitment for next steps:**
    * "Would it make sense to include [decision maker] in our next conversation?" [cite: 101]
    * "I'd love to share this directly with [CEO name]. When could we make that happen?" [cite: 102]
* **Handle resistance to involving decision-makers:**
    * "I understand [decision maker] is busy. What if we prepared a focused presentation specifically addressing their key concerns?" [cite: 103]
    * "Would it help if we put together some initial numbers for you to share with them first?" [cite: 104]
* **Example Approach:** "Thanks for walking me through this. Given the scope of impact we've discussed, it would probably be valuable to include [CEO name] in our next conversation. I know they're busy - we could do a focused 30-minute session just walking through the ROI and implementation approach. What's the best way to get that scheduled?" [cite: 105]

We'll treat your project or product like it’s our own and do whatever it takes, with a founder level mentality, to make it spectacularly successful. We have extreme professional pride and do not consider failure an option. We will do what it takes to do right by our clients. We balance being realistic with dreaming big and will use our collective expertise and hustle to figure out what we need to do within the project’s constraints and do it. We strive to not only produce high quality code, designs, data science solutions, but to understand you and your organization’s goals so that we can be constantly pushing them forward through the work we are doing. In thinking of what the “right” thing to do is, we aim to do what is best for you and your business, not just what is easiest, safest, coolest, etc. This mentality applies to all the work we do, from the program director strategizing with you on high level opportunities to the microdecisions a developer makes while coding a feature.

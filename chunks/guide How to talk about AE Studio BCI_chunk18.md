### Commercialization & Product Impact:
AE’s partnerships with neurotech firms (Blackrock, Forest, StrokeDX, etc.) demonstrate their role in bringing BCI innovations to market. By providing engineering and UX expertise to these companies, AE shortens the path from lab discovery to real-world product. For example, their work on Blackrock’s MoveAgain platform is directly contributing to what could become a widely available BCI therapy for paralysis (Neurotechnology Consulting). As these products succeed, AE Studio’s behind-the-scenes contributions translate into improved patient outcomes (e.g. helping paralyzed individuals regain mobility) and the opening of new BCI markets (such as clinical neurorehabilitation tools and neuro-diagnostic devices).

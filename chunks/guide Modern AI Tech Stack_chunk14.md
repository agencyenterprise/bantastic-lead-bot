* **Azure Text-to-Speech:** Provides enterprise-grade neural voice synthesis with its API delivering precise phoneme-level timestamps in the response, enabling perfect audio-text synchronization and detailed speech analysis capabilities.
* **Stable Diffusion / Riffusion:** Open-source AI models for generating high-quality images or music. Very customizable with many models and checkpoints available, allowing to create APIs for real-time image generation.
* **Midjourney:** A cloud-based image generation service that allows users to create high-quality images using AI. Probably the best image generation tool for creating realistic images, but cannot be used as an API.

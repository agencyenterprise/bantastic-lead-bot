Kadena partnered with AE Studio because of our blockchain development expertise to help them expand wallet support and optimize user adoption. Kadena believes that blockchain technology can revolutionize how people communicate and interact, in a secure way without a centralized authority, while being both transparent and privacy-preserving. The Kadena platform provides a completely decentralized infrastructure of nodes and tools for teams to launch products without having to build from scratch. And Kadena is the only scalable layer-1 Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain in the industry.

The AE team expanded the functionality of the Enkrypt wallet with KDA balance display, transaction signing and account-associated transactions list rendering. Our team coordinated with both the Kadena and the MyEtherWallet (MEW) teams to integrate features with Enkrypt, a collaboration vital to ensuring MEW standard compliance.

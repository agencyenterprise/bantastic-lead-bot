Learning and Adaptation 
* Early implementation provides valuable learning experience and organizational knowledge.
* Starting now puts the company in a stronger position to make future adjustments.
* Building from a position of experience is better than starting from scratch later.

Implementation Strategy 
* Focus on solving current problems and bringing immediate business returns.
* Consider an API-first approach to allow for future integration with commoditized services.
* Scout technology trends to make informed decisions about which components might be replaced later.

### Closing and Next Steps (When 5 minutes left on the call)
What to say: "Based on what you've shared today, I think there's a great opportunity for us to help with [specific challenge/opportunity]. Would you be interested in scheduling a solutions design workshop where we can dive deeper into your needs and explore potential approaches? We can also share some additional case studies and examples that might be relevant to your situation. 

Let's take a moment to schedule that next meeting before we wrap up today. I find it's always easier to get it on the calendar now while we're all here. What does your schedule look like next week?" 
Why it works: Creates momentum by proposing clear next steps while reinforcing that you've been listening to their needs.
*Scheduling the next meeting before ending the call ensures continuity and demonstrates your commitment to moving forward.* 
*Allow client to respond and discuss potential next steps, and work to find a mutually agreeable time*

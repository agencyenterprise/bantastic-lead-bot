### How do I know this AI solution will work?
This type of objection is a trust-based objection.

* We've worked with such and such big brands...80% of our business is referral and repeat business.
* We wouldn't have repeat business from Samsung, Walmart, SpaceX, Berkshire Hathaway, if we weren't able to deliver at a very high level.
* We've done this before.
* Use stance where you acknowledge and agree with prospect and confirm suspicions (what they have doesn't work) and we're the venue for a solution.
* Get aggressive, don't wait, tell them we're looking to do this asap, we're busy, etc..
* Questions to ask the prospect (let's have them sell themselves): What makes you think that this is so unique that our DS wouldn't be able to accomplish (we don't see it) we've worked with everyone.
* It's not about what someone else tried to do: What makes you think we can't do it?.

### Billing & Invoicing

We send invoices bi-monthly for time tracked during that billing cycle. Time is broken out by function since data science is billed at a higher rate. We appreciate your prompt payment of invoices. Running projects incurs significant costs to AE, including that we pay all of our team members working on your project very well and on time, so we will unfortunately need to pause work if invoices become significantly overdue.

### Research Collaborations:
To bolster its neuroscience expertise, AE Studio collaborates with leading experts in the field. Dr. Sumner Norman, a noted BCI researcher who served as AE’s Chief BCI Scientist, and Professor Michael Graziano of Princeton (an expert on the neurological basis of consciousness) have both worked with AE’s team (Developing a BCI Operating System). These collaborations merge academic insight with AE’s development capabilities, ensuring the company’s projects incorporate state-of-the-art cognitive science and neuroengineering knowledge. Such partnerships amplify AE’s R&D efforts in areas like understanding consciousness and improving brain-signal decoding.

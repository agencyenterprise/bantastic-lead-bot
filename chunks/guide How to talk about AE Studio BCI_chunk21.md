## Future Directions:

### Deepening BCI Focus & Independence:
AE Studio plans to stay the course on its long-term BCI and human-agency mission. The company remains fully bootstrapped and has explicitly avoided taking on shareholders or VC funding, ensuring it can prioritize neurotechnology advancements over short-term profit pressures (Developing a BCI Operating System). We can expect AE to continue scaling its team of top developers, scientists, and designers dedicated to BCI, as it believes it’s “only 1% as good” as it could be – signaling significant growth and improvement ahead (Developing a BCI Operating System). This suggests ongoing development of foundational BCI software (a sort of brain-computer “operating system”) and hardware-agnostic tools aimed at broadening what BCI can do.

### Company Overview
What to say: "Thanks for sharing that. Let me tell you a bit about AE Studio. We're an AI-first software development agency with all in-house teams of data scientists with PhDs, developers, and designers. We build end-to-end products and pride ourselves on the world-class talent we've assembled over the last decade. 

What makes us different is our focus on increasing human agency through technology and delivering solutions that create significant ROI. We're a team in a box, but it's a transparent box - you can see everything happening inside. We approach projects as partners rather than contractors, treating your project like our own." 
Why it works: Concisely communicates AE's core value proposition while emphasizing expertise and partnership approach.

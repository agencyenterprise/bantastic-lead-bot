We partnered with popular TikTok star Elle Kristine to create a groundbreaking AI relationship and dating coach iOS app inspired by her unique insight and capacity to support others both socially and emotionally. In 2 months total downloads increased by 2x.

The AskElle app and its AI Avatar is the first ever peer-led app to give teenagers safe, personalized guidance to navigate the complexities of dating.

Intuitive UX and delightful UI are notable throughout the app. Onboarding, customizing preferences, interacting with the AI Avatar, anonymously adding and chatting with crushes, and managing user profiles are all designed to be easy to accomplish and agency-increasing for the teen user.

In addition to the core features, we developed a robust monetization system, introduced gamification elements, and implemented workflows to easily invite friends and increase network effects.

## Business and Market Impact:

### Sustainable Neurotech Investment Model:
AE Studio’s business model uniquely links a consulting revenue stream with deep tech R&D. Profits from their software consulting services are funneled into BCI and neuroscience ventures (Developing a BCI Operating System), allowing continuous innovation without reliance on external investors. This self-funded approach (growing the company from 0 to ~150 employees with no venture capital) provides strategic independence (Developing a BCI Operating System). It enables AE to pursue long-term, high-impact neurotech projects (their “Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal” being agency-enhancing BCI) rather than chasing short-term commercial wins (Developing a BCI Operating System).

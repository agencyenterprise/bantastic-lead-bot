### Accelerating Industry Innovation:
Through open-source releases and competition sponsorships, AE Studio actively propels the neurotech field forward. By open-sourcing their NLB-winning algorithms and sponsoring the next phase of that challenge, theyâ€™ve incentivized broader progress in brain-signal machine learning (Developing a BCI Operating System). Their contributions to standards (like BIDS) and tools lower duplication of effort across startups and labs, speeding up development cycles across the industry (Developing a BCI Operating System). In essence, AE shares its R&D gains with the community, which helps the entire BCI/neuroscience ecosystem advance more rapidly and cost-effectively.

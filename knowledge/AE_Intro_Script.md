Why it works: Establishes credibility immediately by sharing your specific role and expertise, building trust from the start.
*Pause for client's brief introduction* 

### Agenda Setting
What to say: "For our call today, I'd like to propose a simple agenda: we'll start with brief introductions from our team, then we'd love to hear about your business and challenges. After that, we'll share a bit about AE Studio and explore how we might be able to help. Finally, we'll discuss potential next steps. Does that sound good to you?"

*Pause after introductions* 

### Client Discovery (10-15 minutes)
What to say: "Now we'd love to hear more about [Client Company]. What are you working on currently? What challenges are you facing that led you to this conversation? What are your goals for this potential partnership?" 
Why it works: Puts the focus on the client early, showing you're interested in understanding their needs before pitching your services.
*Give client ample time to explain their business, challenges, and goals - this should be the longest single segment of the call* 

This is a good time to BANT.

### Company Overview
What to say: "Thanks for sharing that. Let me tell you a bit about AE Studio. We're an AI-first software development agency with all in-house teams of data scientists with PhDs, developers, and designers. We build end-to-end products and pride ourselves on the world-class talent we've assembled over the last decade. 

What makes us different is our focus on increasing human agency through technology and delivering solutions that create significant ROI. We're a team in a box, but it's a transparent box - you can see everything happening inside. We approach projects as partners rather than contractors, treating your project like our own." 
Why it works: Concisely communicates AE's core value proposition while emphasizing expertise and partnership approach.
*Pause briefly to allow client to process information* 

### Value and ROI Focus
What to say: "We focus on projects that deliver at least six-figure ROI. We're not just building technology - we're creating solutions that drive real business value. That's why we take the time to understand your business challenges and opportunities before jumping into development. 

Everything we build belongs to you. We're making custom software for your specific needs, not licensing something we've built. All the IP is yours." 
Why it works: Emphasizes business value and addresses common client concerns about IP ownership upfront.
*Pause for any immediate questions from client* 

### AI Expertise Highlight
What to say: "We stay on the absolute bleeding edge of AI. Our team includes PhDs in machine learning and data science, and we're constantly experimenting with the latest technologies. We not only implement AI in our products but also use it to improve our own development process - for example, many of our team members use AI to accelerate coding and design." 
Why it works: Demonstrates deep AI expertise as a key differentiator and shows you practice what you preach.
*Pause for client reaction or questions* 

### Process and Pricing Transparency
What to say: "Our process typically starts with an intro call like this, followed by a solutions design workshop where we dig deeper into your needs. After that, we develop a proposal with our recommendations. We work iteratively and fast-paced, often delivering an MVP within a couple of months. 

In terms of investment, our minimum engagements typically start around $150K, with market-ready MVPs often in the $250K+ range. We charge on a time and materials basis, which gives us flexibility to pivot as needed. We're transparent about this upfront because we want to make sure we're aligned on expectations." 

Why it works: Sets clear expectations about process and pricing, qualifying prospects and ensuring time isn't wasted on misaligned projects.
*Pause for client reaction to pricing and process information* 

If you havenâ€™t already touched on Budget with the client, this is a good time to see how they react.

### Relevant Case Studies
What to say: "Based on what you've shared about [specific challenge/industry], I think our work with [relevant client] might be particularly interesting to you. We [brief description of solution and results]." 
Why it works: Makes the conversation concrete by sharing relevant examples that demonstrate your capability to solve similar problems.
*Pause for client questions about case studies* 

### Closing and Next Steps (When 5 minutes left on the call)
What to say: "Based on what you've shared today, I think there's a great opportunity for us to help with [specific challenge/opportunity]. Would you be interested in scheduling a solutions design workshop where we can dive deeper into your needs and explore potential approaches? We can also share some additional case studies and examples that might be relevant to your situation. 

Let's take a moment to schedule that next meeting before we wrap up today. I find it's always easier to get it on the calendar now while we're all here. What does your schedule look like next week?" 
Why it works: Creates momentum by proposing clear next steps while reinforcing that you've been listening to their needs.
*Scheduling the next meeting before ending the call ensures continuity and demonstrates your commitment to moving forward.* 
*Allow client to respond and discuss potential next steps, and work to find a mutually agreeable time* 

### Final Questions
What to say: "Before we wrap up, do you have any other questions about AE Studio or how we work that I can answer for you?" 
Why it works: Ensures the client has all the information they need and demonstrates your openness to questions.
*Give client time to ask final questions*

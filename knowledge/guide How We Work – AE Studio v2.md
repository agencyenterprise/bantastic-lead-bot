# Hi, we’re AE Studio. Our Guarantee

We’ll treat your product or project like it’s our own, and do whatever it takes, with a founder-level mentality to make it spectacularly successful. 

## How we can help you:

We do full end-to-end product development, from early MVP to millions of users or special projects within larger tech ecosystems.  We can be your whole tech team or work alongside your team.  We prefer long term partnerships where we work together for years continuing to support you, but can also do independent initiatives and hand off to internal or other teams.  We have expertise in basically anything you would need to execute on a tech project - AI, Blockchain, Product Design, Software Development, Branding, Product Management, etc. in spaces ranging from BCI to fashion.  Except hardware, we’ll work with it but we aren’t going to be making any physical devices out of our Abbot Kinney office for you.  We can work in nearly all modern languages and frameworks.  We’re not dogmatic, we pick the right tool for the job. 

## How we work:

* Agile, weekly feature prioritization, daily standups, weekly demos. 
* Close collaboration and high transparency with stakeholders. 
* Fast paced, getting things done but with quality. 
* No BS - we’ve left tens of millions in billables on the table to make sure our clients don’t spend money on things they don’t need. 

## Who you’ll work with:

* Smart competent people who don’t have huge egos. 
* People who went to fancy colleges, people who dropped out of them, ex FANG, ex YC, people who didn’t have fancy names on their resume but are the smartest people you’ll ever meet, math geeks, hip designers - people of all different backgrounds who are just phenomenal at their jobs. 
* Projects are assigned a core team who are full time, thinking about your project in the shower - some combination of PM, designers, developers, and data scientists (depending on the project) plus have the support of company leadership and the wider organization. 

## What we don’t do / aren’t:

* A cheap ‘outsource’ option. 
* Small engagements under 100k - we put a ton of effort into every one of our engagements so smaller projects just don’t work with our model. 
* Fixed scope projects - we can work towards a budget, timeline, or requirements but we don’t think good software is produced by defining a long fixed spec sheet ahead of time that must be inflexibly carried out even as things change. 

Thanks for still reading beyond the first page of our one pager - here's some random cool things we've done:

* Developing next-gen adaptive AI learning tools with Alpha School, raising student scores to the top 2% in the U.S. through AI-powered tools for literacy, writing, and tutoring. 
* We won first place in the Neural Latent Benchmark Challenge, a competition in the BCI community that applies machine learning to neural signals. 
* We have open-sourced our solution and funded the second round of the competition as a means to propel the BCI field forward. 
* We open-sourced a state-of-the-art AI model for decoding imagined handwriting from brain signals and for delivering high-performance brain-to-text communication. 
* We worked closely with EVgo, the largest charging network in America to spearhead many of their initiatives ranging from mobile app rollout to internal tools to the successful launch of the eXtend product which resulted in a double digit percentage increases in their stock price. 
* We won a best paper award at NeurIPS for our paper Ignore Previous Prompt: Attack Techniques for Language Models (now referenced over 100 times by the AI community). 
* We’ve worked with Electronic Arts to set up appropriate evaluation frameworks for tracking and optimization of their internal LLM systems. 
* We have been technology partners to Protocol Labs (developers of IPFS, Filecoin, etc) for many years leading projects including debugging tools for Filecoin ahead of mainnet launch, testing and optimizations for libp2p's gossip sub protocol in preparation for its integration into ETH 2.0, writing developer documentation, and development of the Emissary platform which has processed ~25M FIL (~$200M USD) and is growing at ~20% MoM.  We’re currently in the process of open sourcing it, so will be able to share that code soon! 
* Facilitated neural data simulation of complex systems to accelerate the development of closed-loop BCIs (Neural Data Simulator) and transcranial brain stimulation technologies (through our Neurotech Development Kit) — both open source. 
* We led the efforts for “Magic Ethen”, the successful launch of support for the Ethereum chain on Magic Eden.  Magic Eden is the top NFT marketplace for Solana and one of the largest NFT marketplaces in the world, and this was their first expansion into multichain support. 
* We also designed and built an intuitive and highly secure 100% on-chain verified platform to bridge from Terra to Polygon after the collapse of Terra in collaboration with Polygon and OnePlanet that enabled NFTs to be migrated from Terra to Polygon with a near 100% success rate. 
* Engaged in several development and data science projects for Biocentury, including a seamless relaunch of their platform using modern technology after migrating 27 years of content from a legacy system and an initiative to automate data entry of drug pipelines which reduced the need for manual labor that would have otherwise cost Biocentury many millions of dollars over the next few years. 
* Worked collaboratively with the neuroscience community to develop standards and secure methods of analyzing neural data and to train and evaluate privacy-preserving machine learning models. 
* Developed MVPs and beyond for dozens of startups.  Some fun ones include Best Apps where we acted as their entire tech team developing a platform and apps to allow for fans to collaborate with brands to create custom apparel.  Their main app had over 300k downloads with millions of visits per day during major launches with A-list celebs like Arianna Grande and Justin Bieber. 
* For another startup Point, we developed a proprietary health scoring, insight and recommendation engine and accompanying mobile app for users and later turned this into an SDK, enabling them to raise multiple rounds and begin talks with major fitness brands. 
* We built and sold a startup, ElectricSMS, which allows users to easily manage their subscriptions via text message, for 8 figures. 
* Led the development of metadata standards for near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for BIDS which became the standard accepted by the community. 
* We developed a clustering algorithm and dashboard for tracking inventory changes in grocery stores for Berkshire Hathaway. 
* Created specification and companion API for storing and sharing NIRS data for NWB (NDX-NIRS). 
* Supported the development of several open-source neuro-analysis software projects, like MNE, OpenEphys with our OpenEphysLSL plugin, and Lab Streaming Layer, and sit on the steering committee of some of these packages. 
* We are working with Jupiter Intelligence to develop an interactive chatbot for their climate risk analysis platform.  Our custom text-to-SQL data pipeline can interact with over 400 billion data points. 
* We also are deeply interested in AI alignment and we’ve been working on a draft of our alignment agenda.  We would love any comments or feedback you may have on this. 

And here's a few of the nice things people have said about us so you know we're not making it all up:

* Independent, capable, and focused, you guys nimbly managed our many projects with effective, thorough communication skills and tackled our complex problems.  - Jesse Clayburgh, Protocol Labs 
* AE produced strong deliverables with impressive speed.  AE is flexible and assesses challenges thoroughly, leading to the building of effective solutions.  Your dedication, attentiveness, and valuable recommendations are why we’ve worked together for so long.  - David Smiling, Biocentury 
* I’ve never had such an easy, bug free public launch before.  This really speaks to the quality of the code…. We have tons of users already and everything is working perfectly - no alarms, no snags, nothing.  - Daniel Archer, Ritual 
* They have strong opinions, as they should in their areas of expertise, and honor the strong opinions of their clients that allows for a great finished project and doesn't make you feel railroaded.  - Tracy Hinds, Samsung 
* AE Studio is transparent, efficient, and creative all at the same time.  They allow us to understand exactly what’s happening.  Their team has more than just basic implementation skills, they have people that can really redefine what it is you’re looking for and create solutions.  I have yet to find another agency that could do that for me as quickly and effectively as they have.  - Director, Unnamed Hawthorne Aerospace Technology Company 

## Why do we bother with all of this?

Our vision is to **increase human agency**. 

We believe that technology should increase rather than decrease human agency.  We are optimistic about the future and believe in the enormous potential of technology to improve human existence, but also believe that there are great risks to human agency if we don’t proactively ensure that technology is developed in an agency increasing way.  We not only aim to build agency increasing products with our clients, but use our profits to fund internal R&D efforts to advance the fields of BCI and AI Alignment.  We are proud to have made significant advances in these fields by focusing on neglected areas and bringing a unique approach.  To complement these long term initiatives, we also donate to highly effective charities which have near-immediate impacts.  By choosing to work with AE, you are helping to save children from malaria and prevent the AI apocalypse.  We also type really fast.

## AE FAQ for BD Calls.md

### How many people do you have?
150 developers, data scientists, designers, and PMs – and growing.
80% of our team are former founders, 100% have 10+ years of experience in the field.
All of our team are AI-native and fully adopt AI across their workflows, from managing their calendar to developing products.

### How are we staying on top of AI? How do we pass on those learnings and efficiencies to clients?
Every time a new AI technology comes out, our same-day skunkworks team develops and deploys a product using that technology within 24-48 hours.
You can learn more about our same-day skunkworks projects here ([https://ae.studio/same-day-skunkworks](https://ae.studio/same-day-skunkworks)).
Our same-day skunkworks team shares their learnings internally via documented reports and weekly internal demos.

We share our learnings and efficiencies with clients via:
* Our AE Studio Bytes newsletter ([https://aestudio.beehiiv.com/](https://aestudio.beehiiv.com/)) 
* Adopting the latest AI technology into our ongoing projects ASAP 
* Sharing our experiences and recommendations with clients via our shared slack channel, daily standups, and weekly demos 

### What are our payment terms?
$96k retainer to lock in a client’s place in line for allocations.
We bill for time and materials every 15 days (2 weeks in arrears).
We use net-15 payment terms.

For Alternative Billing Structure Objections:
* If competitors: Ask which competitors they're talking to for context.
* Differentiate by explaining why we use time & materials vs SOW billing.
* Position it as a sign of premium quality - "we can charge this way because we're the best".

### What percentage of your company is in Brazil vs USA vs other places?
50% / 50% Brazil and USA with a smattering of folks around the rest of the world.

### High level estimates for AE?
(We can always deflect this if we don't want to share).

Minimum project size of $150k with a 6-8 week start date after receipt of retainer.

If they complain about timeline or capacity objections:
* Frame being at capacity as a positive - "we have more demand than supply because we're best in class".
* Create urgency with FIFO (first in, first out) principle - delays without deposit could push start dates further.
* Strategy pre-defined with allocations info: Use Sprint Zero (discovery phase) to buy time - start discovery 2-3 weeks out while waiting for full team availability.

### How would you guys scale up if we needed to go into 10 projects?
We will work with you to scope out the new projects, provide accurate estimates, write up proposals, and allocate new teams to work on those projects.

Importantly:
* Plant the seed that growth is possible but must be planned.
* Treat each new department as a new account with its own timeline.
* Emphasize that waiting for premium service is worth the opportunity cost.

### How often are your project cost & time estimates correct?
"That's an excellent question, and it's one I'd be concerned about too if I were in your position. We're extremely careful about our estimates because we know how crucial accurate planning is for your business. 
Our approach is different from most firms in three key ways: 
First, we deliberately frame our estimates as ranges rather than fixed points. For example, instead of saying 'exactly 8 weeks,' we typically provide a window like '8-10 weeks.'  This accounts for the inherent complexity and variables of AI development work. 
Second, we include buffer time in our planning. We know from experience that technical projects often encounter unexpected challenges. Our team's PhDs and senior engineers have developed a methodology where we estimate the work, then add 20-40% padding based on the project's complexity. This approach has helped us maintain a strong track record of delivering within our estimated ranges for our clients. 
Third, we maintain complete transparency throughout the product development process. You'll receive weekly demos showing exactly what we've built, allowing us to course-correct early if needed rather than surprising you several weeks into the project. 
If you're concerned about estimates specifically, I'm curious - have you had negative experiences with vendors missing deadlines or exceeding budgets in the past?" 

### Have you worked on any projects in my field / related to my project?
Use the BD case studies Claude project ([https://claude.ai/project/0a14a666-3cda-4106-bc27-28c6c8c74256](https://claude.ai/project/0a14a666-3cda-4106-bc27-28c6c8c74256)) to look up related case studies.
Look at the pre-call overview for preliminary queries.

### How do I know this AI solution will work?
This type of objection is a trust-based objection.

* We've worked with such and such big brands...80% of our business is referral and repeat business.
* We wouldn't have repeat business from Samsung, Walmart, SpaceX, Berkshire Hathaway, if we weren't able to deliver at a very high level.
* We've done this before.
* Use stance where you acknowledge and agree with prospect and confirm suspicions (what they have doesn't work) and we're the venue for a solution.
* Get aggressive, don't wait, tell them we're looking to do this asap, we're busy, etc..
* Questions to ask the prospect (let's have them sell themselves): What makes you think that this is so unique that our DS wouldn't be able to accomplish (we don't see it) we've worked with everyone.
* It's not about what someone else tried to do: What makes you think we can't do it?.

### How do I know this custom AI solution won’t be replaced / commoditized / outdated in 3-6 months because the AI field is moving so quickly?
Addressing Client Hesitation 
* Build solutions in a modular way to easily integrate improved technology when it becomes available.
* Being first to market and establishing a user base provides competitive advantage.
* Commoditized versions rarely align perfectly with specific business needs.

Business Value Arguments 
* Having a working solution that generates ROI now is better than waiting for future technology.
* Calculate the advantage of having a solution 3-6 months earlier versus waiting.
* The opportunity cost of delaying AI integration is too high to justify waiting.

Learning and Adaptation 
* Early implementation provides valuable learning experience and organizational knowledge.
* Starting now puts the company in a stronger position to make future adjustments.
* Building from a position of experience is better than starting from scratch later.

Implementation Strategy 
* Focus on solving current problems and bringing immediate business returns.
* Consider an API-first approach to allow for future integration with commoditized services.
* Scout technology trends to make informed decisions about which components might be replaced later.

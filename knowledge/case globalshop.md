We built a custom API using GPT-4 Vision to parse the data Global Shop Solutions had been aggregating manually from invoices, vendor quotes and other documents. The API connects that data to the enterprise resource planning (ERP) software Global Shop Solutions provides for manufacturing enterprises. ERP users now retrieve the values extracted from the documents–including data like gross totals, date and vendor–automatically from the interface. Our custom AI model transcribes these documents with 95% accuracy, so team members now only have to review the values and save the documents, decreasing overhead cost by 90%.

In less than 10 weeks we developed and delivered a custom build, wrote detailed API documentation and collaborated closely with the GSS engineering team to ensure a smooth handover. AE Studio surpassed Global Shop Solutions expectations – delivering two weeks sooner than the original goal, and building a model that was 15% more accurate than expected.

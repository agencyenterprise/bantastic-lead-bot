# How We Work

We know that software and AI development can be hard, but we have extensive experience executing complex, fast-moving projects for our clients and take our client guarantee seriously. We know that adaptability is key to building great products and our processes and team structure have been very effective in ensuring that we’re always on the same page and potential problems are caught before they become issues. Included is more detailed information about what it’s really like to work with us, but here is a tl;dr what we do to make sure things go well:

## tl;dr

* **high transparency** about what is being done each and every day through daily standups and visibility on our project management tools.
* **regular meetings** to detail and prioritize features.
* **weekly demos and regular releases** to encourage early testing and feedback.
* **open and early discussions** about potential risks or suggested changes (something fun we do around this is a Pre Post Mortem during the kickoff process… this exercise allows us to think ‘what went wrong’ before we even start the project to make sure we’re thinking about these things as we build).
* **highly skilled team members** with a founder level mentality towards the projects they work on.
* **tech directors** to provide an outside perspective on the project, collaborate on key decisions, and ensure the project team is delivering high quality work.
* **program directors** to provide strategic guidance, ensure the project is on track, and hear any feedback from you to ensure you are satisfied with the engagement.
* **the support of the larger AE team** to make things as successful as possible.
* our **product centric** approach to agile, which means we care don’t just care about clean code as a best practice, but also thinking deeply about trade-offs in collaboration with you to do the right thing at the right time in order for you to accomplish your objectives with our engagement.

## Our Guarantee

We'll treat your project or product like it’s our own and do whatever it takes, with a founder level mentality, to make it spectacularly successful. We have extreme professional pride and do not consider failure an option. We will do what it takes to do right by our clients. We balance being realistic with dreaming big and will use our collective expertise and hustle to figure out what we need to do within the project’s constraints and do it. We strive to not only produce high quality code, designs, data science solutions, but to understand you and your organization’s goals so that we can be constantly pushing them forward through the work we are doing. In thinking of what the “right” thing to do is, we aim to do what is best for you and your business, not just what is easiest, safest, coolest, etc. This mentality applies to all the work we do, from the program director strategizing with you on high level opportunities to the microdecisions a developer makes while coding a feature.

## Technology Approach

We are product-first in our thinking and approach to building software solutions. We don’t use the shiniest new ML architecture just for the sake of it or rewrite everything for the 3rd time in order to adopt the trendiest new JS library just because we read a Hacker News post about it. We have top talent that is excited to use their skills to bring amazing products to life rather than just focusing on the coolest tech. When evaluating trade-offs or considering options, we evaluate what would be best in improving the product and delivering on the goals of the business and communicate with you about our recommendations based on that framework. In order to be able to do this, we work closely with our clients to understand not only their immediate roadmap but also the long-term vision for the product. With deep engineering and startup experience across our team, we understand what factors are important to consider in order to give our clients the best possible chance for success, both now and as their company and team grows.

## Our Process

We practice agile with a product-centric approach. We have a standard process which has worked very well for many clients, but we also understand that clients and projects are different and are happy to adapt to your needs.

### Kickoff

In order for us to deeply understand your business and product needs in order to develop the best thing possible, we need to get a lot of information and context from you. Kickoff is a great way to get rapidly up to speed with this context in a friendly workshop setting. You don’t need to prepare for this, our aim is to extract from you all the info you already have and know. After kickoff, our regular weekly meetings tend to be even more productive because we are coming in from a place of mutual understanding to discuss week over week needs in greater detail. The following are activities we typically do in kickoffs, but we allow the meeting to flow naturally and often skip or lengthen some of these if it makes sense as the meeting progresses:

* introductions
* mission, vision, big hairy audacious goal, client/customer guarantee (AE & client)
* goals, metrics, north star metric
* key milestones & important dates
* personas
* review PO & workshop
* agile sliders
* raci chart
* next steps

Before kickoff, we meet internally to get the current team up to speed on what was discussed during the sales process, but it is still useful and important to hear information directly from you so don’t hesitate to repeat information that you have already shared.

Additionally, if there was a specific project that we have already scoped and estimated, the team is brought up to speed on the current assumptions about our approach and the scope that was discussed which became the basis for the provided estimates. However, we always work in an agile manner and understand that priorities evolve and shift over time. The weekly activities defined below are how we get on the same page about what we should be working on, adapt to new information and changes as the project evolves, and navigate tradeoffs. Scope, budget, and time are all interconnected levers and it is our goal to build the best possible thing for you given whatever constraints may exist. We will provide guidance and suggestions on how to navigate tradeoffs and make the best product decisions, but you will always be the ultimate decision maker about what we work on and prioritize throughout the project. Even if we disagree with a particular decision, we will always let you know about the risks we see, but then fully commit to and try our hardest to execute well on the path that was decided.

### Weekly Activities

We typically work in weekly sprints and practice CI/CD. The goal of these weekly touchpoints is to ensure we are always on the same page and to demonstrate weekly progress. A typical week looks like:

* **daily standups** [5 min, daily, entire team - each person explains what they finished, what they are currently working on, what they will work on after that, and any blockers] 
* **design & story writing** [30 min - 1 hr, beginning of the week, part of team - discuss high level priorities & milestones, review designs, write and/or reviews stories with acceptance criteria] 
* estimation [30 min - 1 hr, middle of the week, entire team, client optional - review stories that are written, ensure team understands requirements, discuss any potential optimizations, discuss technical approach, assign point values to stories representing complexity] 
* **retro / demo** [30 min - 1 hr, end of the week, entire team - review what went well during the previous week and what could be improved, demo new features worked on that week whether done or in-progress] 
* acceptance [30 min, end of the week often directly following retro / demo, PM - review completed stories and ensure they meet acceptance criteria] 
* **program director call** [15 min - 30 min, anytime during week, only program director - discuss how the project is going at a high level, allocations / resources / budget, discuss the business and strategic initiatives] 

The meetings above in bold are the ones that are most important for you to attend each week, as it helps us ensure that we are all on the same page and that what we are working on is aligned with your expectations. If you can attend daily stand ups as well, that is even better!  We prefer to work with you as collaboratively as possible. In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, we communicate asynchronously in Slack or the platform of your preference and can schedule ad-hoc meetings as needed. Prompt responses and trusting that you will review shared materials like posted updates or demo links are really helpful in making sure we are as efficient as possible, so please coordinate with your team so we can make this as easy as possible for you and in line with your preferred communication style. We believe that sharing information and context saves a lot of your very valuable time overall by preventing surprises and pre-empting issues. One of our core values is overcommunication and we will do this throughout the project and encourage you to do this with us as well. Please don’t feel hesitant to share a half formed idea, a slight concern, or a fact that might or might not be relevant, we want to hear it all! 

### Our approach to Agile Development

We aim to continuously deliver working software and improve it iteratively over time with constant feedback and testing. There are always tradeoffs to manage and we work closely with you to make the right decisions at different points in time considering what is best for your business and goals. It is because we believe this is the most effective way to build great products that we do not do fixed scope agreements and instead always bill time & materials. This gives you the flexibility to decide what the best way to spend the team’s time at any given time is, rather than being held to an inflexible scope that may no longer make sense as the project progresses. This approach does not mean that we can’t work towards specific milestones or release dates. Please communicate to the team as early as possible about any important dates and what is needed for them as soon as possible. There will always be tradeoffs between scope, team size, and timeline, but your product manager and program director will coordinate with you to decide how to manage these in order to best accomplish your goals within whatever constraints may exist.

### Your Team

Based on the current needs of the project, we selected a group of AE team members who have the skills required to deliver fantastic results for you. Your core team will consist mainly of people who are dedicated to the project full-time, with potentially some people working part-time if this makes more sense given the project's needs. Typically the core project team consists of a product manager and several individual contributors spanning across development, design and data science. Each project also has tech directors from the main technological focus areas (any of data science, design, and development) who work across multiple projects to collaborate on key decisions, find efficiencies and improvements where possible, provide a fresh perspective to the core team and ensure that the project team is delivering high quality work. Your project will also have the support of the wider AE team. Program directors and company leadership will be actively involved in ensuring the success of each project and may also pull in ad-hoc support from the broader team to increase efficiency or quality of delivery.

### Points of Contact

All of our team members are client facing. You will see and talk with them in meetings and over slack. However, as individual contributors require deep maker time to do their best work, we encourage you to direct most of your feedback and requests to your product manager or program director. Typically the product manager is responsible for ensuring that the current product or solution is aligned with your goals so please deeply partner with them. They will be running all of the previously described ceremonies and will be available via slack or for ad-hoc meetings as well as needed. The program director is responsible for higher level strategic planning about how AE can best partner with you and your company to help you be maximally successful and to ensure that your team is doing an amazing job. Your program director has deep experience working across many different companies to not only ensure that specific engagements are successful, but also providing strategic guidance and support, so please use them as a resource and share everything and anything with them. They will have a regularly scheduled weekly 30 minute call with you (which is not billed for) and are also available to you whenever needed and will also run strategic meetings such as kickoff, internal project check ins, and beyond the horizons meetings.

### Allocations

Projects have a core team allocation which may scale up or down when necessary. We typically stick to relatively consistent full or half time allocations for the core team as this is generally aligned with what is most efficient in terms of team member productivity and reducing management costs. You can strategize with your program director about what allocation size and composition may be most appropriate for your current needs. We allocate projects based on what people would be best suited given the needs of the project, so exact team composition may change over time as the needs of the project evolve. The team working on your project are all AE team members who are hand selected and internally developed for their skills and professionalism, but they are also real people who may get sick, take a vacation, or have a family emergency. We have processes in place to provide coverage for these events to ensure the success of your project is not impacted.

### Billing & Invoicing

We send invoices bi-monthly for time tracked during that billing cycle. Time is broken out by function since data science is billed at a higher rate. We appreciate your prompt payment of invoices. Running projects incurs significant costs to AE, including that we pay all of our team members working on your project very well and on time, so we will unfortunately need to pause work if invoices become significantly overdue.

### Other Activities & Capabilities

In addition to regularly scheduled activities, program directors supporting your project will consistently evaluate where your project / product / business currently is and what your future goals are in order to determine if there are other activities which might accelerate your progress. Your program director will collaborate with you to determine how we may best support. Some of these activities may include:

* Design Sprint 
* More Comprehensive User Research or Usability Testing 
* Branding 
* Soft Launch 
* Security Review & Red Team Ops 
* Review of Investor Pitch & Decks 
* Review or Creation of Marketing Materials 
* UX Audit 
* Market Research & Competitive Analysis 
* SEO 
* Beyond the Horizons Meetings 
* Data Science & AI Strategy Consultations 

## Some Cool Things We’ve Done

Here’s a sampling of work we’ve done for clients or internally. We love nerding out about our work, so please let us know if you want to talk about any of this or are interested in hearing more about some of our other projects.

* We won first place in the Neural Latent Benchmark Challenge, a prestigious competition in the BCI community that applies machine learning to neural signals.
* We have open-sourced our solution and funded the second round of the competition as a means to propel the BCI field forward.
* We open-sourced a state-of-the-art AI model for decoding imagined handwriting from brain signals and for delivering high-performance brain-to-text communication.
* We worked closely with EVgo, the largest charging network in America to spearhead many of their initiatives ranging from mobile app rollout to internal tools to the successful launch of the eXtend product which resulted in a double digit percentage increases in their stock price.
* We won a best paper award at NeurIPS for our paper Ignore Previous Prompt: Attack Techniques for Language Models (now referenced over 100 times by the AI community!).
* We’ve worked with Electronic Arts to set up appropriate evaluation frameworks for tracking and optimization of their internal LLM systems.
* We have been technology partners to Protocol Labs (developers of IPFS, Filecoin, etc) for many years leading projects including debugging tools for Filecoin ahead of mainnet launch, testing and optimizations for libp2p's gossip sub protocol in preparation for its integration into ETH 2.0, writing developer documentation, and development of the Emissary platform which has processed ~25M FIL (~$100M USD) and is growing at ~20% MoM. We’re currently in the process of open sourcing it, so will be able to share that code soon!.
* Facilitated neural data simulation of complex systems to accelerate the development of closed-loop BCIs (Neural Data Simulator) and transcranial brain stimulation technologies (through our Neurotech Development Kit) — both open source.
* We led the efforts for “Magic Ethen”, the successful launch of support for the Ethereum chain on Magic Eden. Magic Eden is the top NFT marketplace for Solana and one of the largest NFT marketplaces in the world, and this was their first expansion into multichain support.
* We also designed and built an intuitive and highly secure 100% on-chain verified platform to bridge from Terra to Polygon after the collapse of Terra in collaboration with Polygon and OnePlanet that enabled NFTs to be migrated from Terra to Polygon with a near 100% success rate.
* Engaged in several development and data science projects for Biocentury, including a seamless relaunch of their platform using modern technology after migrating 27 years of content from a legacy system and an initiative to automate data entry of drug pipelines which reduced the need for manual labor that would have otherwise cost Biocentury many millions of dollars over the next few years.
* Worked collaboratively with the neuroscience community to develop standards and secure methods of analyzing neural data and to train and evaluate privacy-preserving machine learning models.
* Developed MVPs and beyond for dozens of startups. Some fun ones include Best Apps where we acted as their entire tech team developing a platform and apps to allow for fans to collaborate with brands to create custom apparel. Their main app had over 300k downloads with millions of visits per day during major launches with A-list celebs like Arianna Grande and Justin Bieber.
* For another startup Point, we developed a proprietary health scoring, insight and recommendation engine and accompanying mobile app for users and later turned this into an SDK, enabling them to raise multiple rounds and begin talks with major fitness brands.
* We built and sold a startup, ElectricSMS, which allows users to easily manage their subscriptions via text message, for 8 figures.
* led the development of metadata standards for near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for BIDS which became the standard accepted by the community.
* We developed a clustering algorithm and dashboard for tracking inventory changes in grocery stores for Berkshire Hathaway.
* created specification and companion API for storing and sharing NIRS data for NWB (NDX-NIRS).
* supported the development of several open-source neuro-analysis software projects, like MNE, OpenEphys with our OpenEphysLSL plugin, and Lab Streaming Layer, and sit on the steering committee of some of these packages.
* we are working with Jupiter Intelligence to develop an interactive chatbot for their climate risk analysis platform. Our custom text-to-SQL data pipeline can interact with over 400 billion data points!.
* we spearheaded the neglected approaches approach to AI alignment.
* we recently published a paper, Unexpected Benefits of Self-Modeling in Neural Systems, which demonstrates that adding self-modeling to artificial networks causes a significant reduction in network complexity, which might be key for prosocial AI.
* We’ve pushing for more (AI) consciousness research, and this research brought a lot more attention to the discussion!.
* we deeply care about doing the best work possible for all of our clients. You can check out some of our verified client reviews and we are more than happy to provide references if desired.

We would be excited to work together - please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions! 

### End of Project Handoffs

We place a high priority on ensuring seamless project handoffs. We achieve this by meticulously documenting each project to facilitate the work of future teams. This process includes a transition period where our team works in tandem with the client's internal resources, providing them with comprehensive onboarding to our methodologies and the project specifics. Clients often appreciate our approach and, on occasion, request our assistance in onboarding future internal team members. Additionally, we offer an optional service where we can assist in interviewing, vetting, or providing feedback on potential team members, ensuring that the client's future development team aligns with their high standards.

here are some sample options we’ve done in the past for maintenance post project development:

* **reduced feature development team** - work with a reduced number of developers or data scientists than the full team, to continue making progress on features while also conducting maintenance, bug fixes, and adjustments.
* **dedicated maintenance skeleton crew** - 1 half-time developer or data scientist allocated - with this, we can guarantee prompt responses and turnaround to reported bugs and issues.
* **on-demand maintenance skeleton crew** - We will be attentive to feature requests and reported bugs - while this won't have the same guaranteed response time as the options above, we aim to respond to requests as soon as possible.
* if any bugs or requests are estimated to be a significant amount of work, we will let you know for approval before working on it.
* Please note that this on-demand plan has a higher rate than the options with dedicated allocation.

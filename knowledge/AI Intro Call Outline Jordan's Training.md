## Opening:

    * “From time to time I may come in and redirect the conversation because I want to make sure we’re able to get to all the key parts of our conversation” 
* Set Intentions Clearly:
    * "Can you give me a quick 2-3 minute overview of why you booked a call with us today and what you’re working on?" 
    * THEN "I'll briefly introduce AE Studio." 
    * "I'll ask a few questions to understand your needs." 
    * "If we're aligned, we'll talk about next steps." 
    * "Does that sound good?" 
    * …They explain what they’re working on. 
    * (repeat back to them)

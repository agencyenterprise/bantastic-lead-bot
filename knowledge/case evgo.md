EVgo is the fastest and largest charging network in America for electric vehicles with over 800 fast-charging locations across 34 states. Since AE Studio started working with EVgo we have been an extension of their tech and product teams, designing and developing enterprise software from the ground up.

From iOS and Android development to online dashboards, we create tools EVgo uses for day-to-day operations. EVgo Extend enables EVgoâ€™s many partners to provide charging benefits to their end customers. EVgo Access gives EVgo the ability to report and take action during key moments while customers are using EVgo equipment. Site Host Portal is a way for EVgo to pass info to and from location hosts. We have been so involved in creating these tools for EVgo, their employees consider us in-house!

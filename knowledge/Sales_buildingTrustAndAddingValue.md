# Sales: Building Trust and Adding Value

## 1. Core Philosophy and Conviction

* **Matching Body Language:** Confidence is key; would you buy from someone unsure of themselves? [cite: 1]
* **Always be serving (instead of always be selling):** Always think about value; technical stuff is irrelevant if it does not bring value. [cite: 2] Be obsessed about value, for example, "we only work on projects that bring companies at least 6 figures of ROI." [cite: 2]
* **Make it obvious that we are the best option.** [cite: 2]
* **Don't make the sales process longer or harder than it needs to be:** make it easy for people to buy. [cite: 3]

## 2. Sales Psychology

### A. Emotional Components

* Sales is an emotional game, not just logical. [cite: 3]
* **Decision-makers face emotional risks:**
    * A 6-figure investment carries career risk for non-C-level executives. [cite: 3]
    * A bad project presents an important opportunity cost risk for C-level executives. [cite: 3]
    * Acknowledge and empathize with that risk. [cite: 3]
* Make them believe that you are not going to screw them over; most people suck, we don't. [cite: 4]
* **Conviction in presentation is crucial:**
    * Believe in your product/service. [cite: 5]
    * Show genuine confidence in your capabilities. [cite: 5]
    * Emotional conviction drives sales more than technical details. [cite: 5]

### B. Building Safety and Trust

* Human brains constantly scan for safety signals. [cite: 5]
* Monotone delivery can signal uncertainty. [cite: 5]
* Use voice modulation to maintain engagement. [cite: 5]
* Create emotional investment in the story. [cite: 5]
* Focus on creating genuine connections. [cite: 5]
* "Sales is about believing you won't get screwed over". [cite: 5]

### C. Building Trust

* Sales is fundamentally about trust on two levels: [cite: 5]
    * Personal trust [cite: 5]
    * Technical trust [cite: 5]
* 93% of communication is body language and tone. [cite: 5]
* 7% is actual content of what's being said. [cite: 5]
* Focus on genuine connection over forced rapport. [cite: 5]
* Be authentic to your personality type. [cite: 5]

### D. Using Social Proof

* **Reference work with major companies strategically:** [cite: 5]
    * "We've worked with SpaceX, Berkshire Hathaway, and Walmart." [cite: 6]
* Use these references to demonstrate capability, not to intimidate. [cite: 5]
* Match references to client's industry or size when possible. [cite: 5]

## 3. Foundational Communication Skills

### A. Active Listening

* This is a core component of building trust. [cite: 6]
* **Key elements:**
    * Recap what you've heard from the prospect. [cite: 6]
    * Acknowledge personal anecdotes. [cite: 6]
    * Reference specific details they've shared. [cite: 6]
    * Keep responses concise and natural. [cite: 6]
    * Don't feel pressured to respond to every point. [cite: 6]
* **Example structure:**
    * "Thank you for sharing that overview..." [cite: 6]
    * Reference specific details they shared. [cite: 6]
    * Connect to relevant personal experience (if authentic). [cite: 6]
    * Transition to next topic. [cite: 6]

### B. Matching and Mirroring

* **Primary rule in sales:** Match and mirror your prospect. [cite: 7]
* **Adapt your communication style to match the client:**
    * Match their energy level. [cite: 7]
    * Adapt speaking pace. [cite: 7]
    * Mirror body language (gradually, not immediately). [cite: 7]
    * Adjust tone and speaking style. [cite: 7]
* Practice matching and mirroring in daily life to make it habitual. [cite: 7]
* Consider cultural and language differences when communicating. [cite: 7]

### C. Personal Connection

* Use genuine personal connections when possible. [cite: 7]
* **Respond to personal anecdotes authentically:**
    * Share relevant personal experiences. [cite: 7]
    * Keep personal shares brief and purposeful. [cite: 7]
    * Connect back to business context. [cite: 7]
* **Example approach:** "That's really interesting about your family business. I've read that only about 10% of family businesses make it to the third generation, so that's quite an achievement." [cite: 8]

### D. Linguistic Tools

* **Strategic use of phrases that build trust:**
    * "Does that sound fair?" - Gets unconscious consent. [cite: 8]
    * "I appreciate you sharing that" - Acknowledges openness. [cite: 8]
* Use metaphors and stories to make points memorable. [cite: 8]
* Practice natural integration of these tools. [cite: 8]
* Avoid sounding scripted or mechanical. [cite: 8]

### E. Making Clients Comfortable

* **Position yourself as an advocate:**
    * "Let us be your advocates in this conversation." [cite: 8]
    * "We're here to help you champion this internally." [cite: 8]
* **Show you're on their side:**
    * Share relevant experiences: "We're bootstrapped too, we understand these decisions." [cite: 9]
    * Acknowledge their constraints: "We totally get it - these are big decisions." [cite: 9]

### F. Example Demonstrations

* **Personal Connection Example:** "That's so cool that you're in a family business. I know the statistics - about 50% fail from first to second generation, and 80-90% fail by the third generation. So what you've achieved is really remarkable." [cite: 10, 11]
* **Building Trust Example:** "I have a great relationship with my dad but never worked with him - I can imagine that must be really fulfilling" or "I never had a great relationship with my dad, so I really admire that you've made that work." [cite: 11]
* **Market Urgency Example:** "There's a small window - two to three years right now - where the people getting to market first are going to reap massive benefits by being early adopters. Even though you don't know exactly what the answer is, you're doing the right thing by exploring." [cite: 12]

### D. Humble Leadership Communication

* Lead with permission-asking: "Do you mind if I...?" [cite: 12]
* Use "we" language to build team perception: "We've been talking about this..." [cite: 12]
* Root all redirection in rapport-building: "I appreciate what you're sharing and want to make sure we address your core needs." [cite: 12]
* When pushing back or redirecting, do so with warmth and humility. [cite: 12]
* Keep the focus on mutual goals: "To make sure we're using our time effectively..." [cite: 12]

### Bonus: Intervening Strategically with ‘Talkative’ Clients (i.e. they won't shut up)

* Lead with apologetic humility: "I'm so sorry and I apologize for cutting you off. Do you mind if I raise something real quick?" [cite: 13]
* Frame interventions as serving the client's interests: "To make sure we respect your time and address all key topics." [cite: 13]
* Use the concept of "rabbit holes" metaphorically: "We're going down this rabbit hole. We can either continue this path or go this other path. Which would you prefer?" [cite: 14, 15]
* Set clear expectations at call start: "Our plan today is to cover X, Y, Z with the goal of getting you a concrete plan by the end." [cite: 15]

## 4. Active Listening Examples

### A. Basic Acknowledgment (do this a lot)

* **Poor Example:** "Yeah, awesome, let me tell you about our solution..." [cite: 15]
* **Strong Example:** "Thank you for sharing that overview. We're in the same space here at AE, always trying to figure out the best way to grow and integrate AI. I appreciate you sharing that perspective." [cite: 16, 17]

### B. More Lengthy Response (when appropriate)

* **Client Example:** "When it comes to medicaldata.com, it's just one of those things. I'm not a tech guy. I built this, my father built this company 20 years ago and I've been working through it. And I kind of know, I know all our vendors and all our partners. And I just know we have so much data that there are, there's so many use cases. There's governmental use cases. There are use cases for PE firms and our clients. And it's just one of those things we don't, we have data analysts, but it takes them a while and it's pretty costly. From what I've seen with AI, I would imagine that there's an opportunity here. And I don't even know what the opportunity is, I just know there is. So I'm a second generation CEO trying to make my name for myself. And I also, I think this is the opportunity." [cite: 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]
* **Strong Active Listening Response:** "Thanks for sharing that background. What I'm hearing is you have this incredible foundation - your father built this company, you've grown it, you have all these relationships and this massive amount of valuable data. You see there's a huge opportunity with AI, especially for government and PE firms, but right now it's costly and slow to analyze. And as a second-generation CEO, you're looking to really transform the business. Is that a fair summary?" [cite: 27, 28, 29, 30]

### C. Handling Uncertainty

* **Client:** "I'm not sure about budget, I've never explored this." [cite: 30]
* **Example 1 - Exploratory Approach:** "That's completely understandable. Many of the firms we work with are exploring AI for the first time. We work with PE firms and VC firms regularly who are looking at these new business models, and there are many different forms this can take. Let's first align on the right approach, and then we can work together on the budget." [cite: 31, 32, 33]
* **Example 2 - Direct Qualification:** "I appreciate your transparency. Let me be upfront - our typical projects are in the six figures. Before we invest more time on both sides, I want to make sure that a six-figure investment would be within range for your business. If it's not, we should probably pause here so we don't waste your valuable time. Would a six-figure investment be something you could consider?" [cite: 34, 35, 36, 37]
* **Example 3 - Combined Approach (Use this one!):** "That's completely understandable. Many firms we work with are exploring AI for the first time, trying to understand both the possibilities and the investment required. Let me be transparent - our typical projects are in the six figures because we provide comprehensive, enterprise-grade solutions. Before we dive deeper, I want to make sure that's within the realm of possibility for your business. If it's not, we should probably pause here to respect your time. If it is, we can explore different approaches and work together to align on the right scope and investment level. Would a six-figure investment be something you could consider?" [cite: 38]

    * Avoid industry jargon. [cite: 42]
    * Don't oversell or exaggerate. [cite: 42]

### B. Introduction Template (PRACTICE THIS ONE 100 TIMES AND BE ABLE TO SAY IT NATURALLY)

* "First, thank you for taking the time to meet with us today. Before we dive into your needs, let me give you a quick overview of AE Studio and myself." (being professional, setting expectations and taking the lead) [cite: 42]
* "AE Studio is a software and AI development agency with a 10-year track record of developing award-winning products. We often partner with Fortune 500 companies and businesses doing $50M+ annually to build transformative software and AI solutions. We've successfully delivered projects for companies like SpaceX, Berkshire Hathaway, and Walmart, helping them leverage AI to drive significant business value." (All about confidence and rapport) [cite: 43]
* "The thing that sets us apart is that we are a premier technical partner that helps companies identify opportunities, architect solutions, and deliver measurable business results. Our team includes PhDs and technical leaders who work on cutting-edge AI solutions, from large language models to custom machine learning applications." (differentiation) [cite: 44]
* **For Startups:** "...As a bootstrapped company ourselves, we understand the importance of delivering real business value quickly. We've helped companies like [relevant startup example] scale their technology..." [cite: 44]
* **[Personal Introduction - Choose the most relevant background point]:**
    * "I'm [Name], and I have a PhD in machine learning from [Institution], with [X] years of experience helping companies implement AI solutions." [cite: 45]
    * "I'm [Name], and I've spent [X] years as a solutions architect, working with companies across [relevant industries] to build and scale technology solutions." [cite: 46]
    * "I'm [Name], and my background is in [area of expertise], where I've helped companies like [relevant example] transform their businesses through technology." [cite: 47]
* "I'm here today to understand your needs and help build a potential roadmap forward." [cite: 48]
* "We typically focus on projects that deliver at least six figures in ROI, as we're committed to creating substantial business value for our partners." (This increases comfort, I am not a salesperson, I am your guide) [cite: 49]
* "Would it be alright if I asked you some questions about your business and what you're looking to accomplish?" (This makes them feel heard and respected) [cite: 49]

## 6. Making the Offer

### A. Building to the Price

* Create anticipation before revealing price. [cite: 49]
* **Address investment criteria:**
    * Recap client's goals. [cite: 49]
    * Reinforce understanding of their needs. [cite: 49]
    * Show how you'll meet their specific requirements. [cite: 49]
* **Build conviction before price reveal:**
    * "We are the best in the marketplace." [cite: 50]
    * "Our founders set the standard." [cite: 50]
    * "You'll get nothing short of exceptional experience." [cite: 50]
* Always have a slide/section in the proposal that shows "why we are the right fit for you" that lists their goals and how this proposal achieves them. [cite: 50]
* **Example:**
    * **Strong Pre-Price Build-up:** "First and foremost, thank you so much for taking the time up until this point. Now, before I walk through the collaboration specifics, I want you to know why this is the right fit. Number one, you told us that you really care about growing your business. When you're thinking about AI and developing your product, your primary concern is different than most people who come to us - you actually want to grow your business. So we've architected this scope and offer to grow your revenue. Everything I've shown you and will show you is with that number one thing in mind. You also told us you need to see a hyper-specific plan that maps out the next 12 weeks that mitigates time risks. We've included that too. And from what I heard from your partner, you want a cohesive integration so we don't have too many cooks in the kitchen. Those are the three reasons why this is going to be the best offer you see and why we are the best fit. And before I share the specifics, one more thing - I'm about to show you some details on who we're deploying and what the plan is. I'm going to be showing you a six-figure investment. The thing I need you to know is that when it comes to AE, we are the best on the marketplace at what we do. Our founders have set the standard for over the last 10 years that we only build elite award-winning level products. We have PhDs, we have geniuses in our company, and you are going to get nothing short of an exceptional experience. The experience, the return on investment, and the value that you're going to get is going to pale in comparison to the investment size." [cite: 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63]

### B. Price Presentation

* Always acknowledge it's a significant investment. [cite: 64]
* Present price with confidence. [cite: 64]
* **Explain ranges if using Agile methodology:**
    * Why ranges exist. [cite: 64]
    * How it benefits the client. [cite: 64]
    * Compare it to flat retainer pricing. [cite: 64]
* Make it a conversation, not a monologue. [cite: 64]
* Pause frequently for questions. [cite: 64]
* Address ambiguity proactively. [cite: 64]

### C. The Close

* **Immediately address two main objections:**
    * "Is this within budget?" [cite: 65]
    * "Do you see the value in this investment?" [cite: 65]
* If yes to both, move directly to payment: [cite: 65]
    * "Would it be crazy if we started today?" [cite: 66] (say this as if you were asking out a stranger to dance with you") Hopeful optimism but leaving them space to operate. [cite: 66]
* Keep it direct and confident. [cite: 66]
* Assume the close. [cite: 66]
* **Example:**
    * **Strong Price Presentation:** "So, as it relates to the investment for you guys, as mentioned prior, this is an investment that we know will yield the results you are seeking. We have a time range of about 7½ to 8½ weeks, and the investment range will be $217,000 to $245,000. Now, we've spoken about it, but I want to address this again. The reason we have a range is we run on something called Agile. A lot of companies will come with a flat retainer fee, and here's why this model is actually better for you: If we were to come with a flat retainer, we would probably price this development at $275,000 to $300,000. Why? Because when pricing on a flat retainer, it doesn't allow flexibility for unforeseen developments. You have to price up an extra 10-30% to account for unknowns. The reason Agile is the best investment for you is that it's not set in stone. Within 2-3 weeks, we'll have better clarity on where we'll land in terms of timeline and investment, and that will be communicated to you. This is the most ideal investment structure for your business and will actually yield the most cost-effective result compared to a flat retainer. Let me pause here for a moment. Based on your company's budget for this project, is this within budget?" [cite: 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76]
    * **After client confirms budget** "Great. And do you see the value in this investment and how it's going to help you accomplish your goals?" [cite: 77]
    * **If yes to both** "Excellent. Would it be crazy if we started today?" [cite: 78]

## 7. Objection Handling

* Always think about potential objections (before the call). [cite: 78] Have levers to pull, and be ready to pull them when you need them. [cite: 78] This could be in the form of different proposals/projects, changing rates (have it pre-approved and thought off), consulting proposals, etc… [cite: 78] That way, you handle objections head-on and don't extend the sale cycle unnecessarily. [cite: 78]

### A. Budget Objections

* **If the prospect says it's not in budget:** [cite: 79]
    * Ask: "What is your budget?" [cite: 79]
    * **If they provide a number:** [cite: 79]
        * Confirm if they would proceed at that budget. [cite: 79]
        * Adjust scope to match budget if possible. [cite: 79]
    * **If they don't know their budget:** [cite: 79]
        * Consider it a red flag. [cite: 79]
        * Be direct about time investment. [cite: 79]
        * Consider pausing engagement until they have clarity. [cite: 79]

### B. Value Objections

* **If the prospect isn't sold on value:** [cite: 79]
    * Ask: "What would you need to see to know this is the right investment?" [cite: 79]
    * Get specific requirements. [cite: 79]
    * Confirm: "If we show you X, Y, and Z, would you be ready to proceed?" [cite: 79]

### C. Hunting for Objections

* The key to effective objection handling is actively seeking out concerns rather than avoiding them. [cite: 80]
* **Core Principles:**
    * Actively hunt for objections - don't wait for them to surface. [cite: 80]
    * Ask follow-up questions to understand the real concern. [cite: 80]
    * Make the prospect feel heard and understood. [cite: 80]
    * Address concerns directly to create safety. [cite: 80]
    * Better to handle objections in the open than let them remain unspoken. [cite: 80]
* **Examples:**
    * **Scenario 1 - Need Partner Approval:** Client: "I need to talk to my partner first." [cite: 81]
        * **Strong Response:** "I completely understand. How about this - even though you're not sure yet, let's put something on the calendar as tentative. You can always decline it, and I'll assume you won't accept unless I hear otherwise. But if you do get that approval, we'll already have the time secured. Does that sound fair?" [cite: 82]
        * **Pro Move:** ask them if their partner can come to the next meeting. [cite: 83]
    * **Scenario 2 - General Hesitation:** Client: "I'm not sure, I need to think about it." [cite: 84]
        * **Strong Response:** "I appreciate that. Actually, before we wrap up - may I ask, do you have any specific apprehensions we should address? No? Okay, let's do this - I know you need time to discuss internally. How about we schedule a brief follow-up for [specific day], and you can always let me know if you need to reschedule. That way, if you're ready to move forward, we haven't lost any momentum." [cite: 85]
    * **Scenario 3 - Unclear Budget/Value:** Client: "Let me think about the budget and get back to you." [cite: 86]
        * **Strong Response:** "Completely understand. Let me ask you - if we came back with a plan that's within your budget of [mentioned amount], what else would you need to see to move forward? [After they answer] Okay, so if we come back with a plan that has [their requirements] and fits within that budget, would that be something you'd be comfortable deciding on? Great - let's book a call for two days out. Today's Friday, so shall we say Tuesday?" [cite: 87]

## 8. Discovery Call Structure

### A. Opening Framework & Call Flow

* **Rapport Building (2-3 minutes):** [cite: 87]
    * Brief, natural introductions. [cite: 87]
    * Find common ground or acknowledge something about them. [cite: 87]
    * Keep it authentic but brief. [cite: 87]
    * Match their energy level. [cite: 87]
* **Set Intention:** [cite: 88]
    * "Do you mind if I set a quick intention for this call?" [cite: 88]
    * **Structure:** "I'd love to get a quick overview of your business, share a bit about myself and AE, ask some questions to understand your needs, and if aligned, discuss next steps." [cite: 89]
    * Always end with: "Does that sound fair?" (creates unconscious agreement). [cite: 89]
    * Keep it direct and confident. [cite: 89]
* **Get Client Overview:** [cite: 89]
    * Let them share their business context. [cite: 89]
    * Practice active listening. [cite: 89]
    * Take detailed notes. [cite: 89]
* **Give AE/Personal Introduction** (see previous section). [cite: 89]
* **Discovery Questions:** [cite: 89]
    * Follow core question framework. [cite: 89]
    * Build to magic wand scenario. [cite: 89]
    * Confirm next steps. [cite: 89]
* **Book Next Steps:** [cite: 89]
    * Never end without a scheduled follow-up. [cite: 89]
    * Address any scheduling hesitation immediately. [cite: 89]

### B. Core Discovery Questions

* **Business Context & Vision:** [cite: 90]
    * "What are your short and long-term business goals, and how do you see AI fitting into that vision?" [cite: 90]
    * Take detailed notes - this becomes critical for later pitch alignment. [cite: 90]
    * Listen for underlying motivations beyond the stated goals. [cite: 90]
* **Pain Points & Opportunities:** [cite: 91]
    * "What are the current pain points or constraints in your business/department?" [cite: 91]
    * This reveals what's actually driving the search for solutions. [cite: 91]
    * Remember to sell to the pain later in the process. [cite: 91]
* **“Magic Wand” Value Projection:** [cite: 92]
    * After identifying goals and pain points, transition to value projection: [cite: 92]
    * "Let me ask you this - if we had a magic wand solution that solved [specific pain point they mentioned], how much more revenue/savings do you think that would generate in the next 12-24 months?" [cite: 92]
    * **Alternative:** "If we could implement the perfect AI solution that addresses [their stated goal], what would that mean in terms of [revenue/cost savings/efficiency] for your business?" [cite: 93]
    * Document their exact numbers - these become crucial for proposals. [cite: 93]
    * Let them provide the value projection - don't make assumptions. [cite: 93]
* **Partnership Criteria:** [cite: 94]
    * "What would you need to see to know you're working with the right partner?" [cite: 94]
    * **OR** [cite: 95]
    * "What specific criteria would the right partner need to meet?" [cite: 95]
    * Watch eye patterns when they answer - indicates their decision-making process. [cite: 95]
    * Their answer gives you the exact roadmap for your pitch. [cite: 95]
* **Investment & Timeline:** [cite: 96]
    * "Do you have a specific budget range in mind for this initiative?" [cite: 96]
    * If unclear: "Our typical projects are in the six figures - would that be within range?" [cite: 97]
    * "What's your timeline for both decision-making and project commencement?" [cite: 97]
* **Strategic Alignment:** [cite: 98]
    * "How does this project connect to the overall goals of your business?" [cite: 98]
    * This reveals the true strategic importance. [cite: 98]
    * Helps you position value proposition later. [cite: 98]
* **Decision Process:** [cite: 99]
    * "Who all is involved in the decision-making process?" [cite: 99]
    * Identify all stakeholders. [cite: 99]
    * Understand approval chain. [cite: 99]
    * **Note:** If not all decision-makers are present, address this: "I notice [person] isn't here today. Should we schedule a follow-up that includes them?" [cite: 100]
    * **Pro tip:** This helps avoid surprises later and ensures you're presenting to all necessary parties. [cite: 100]

### C. Key Principles for Intro Calls

* Connect each answer back to business impact. [cite: 100]
* Don't rush to solutions. [cite: 100]
* Validate understanding frequently. [cite: 100]
* End with clear next steps. [cite: 100]

### D. Red Flags to Watch For

* Inability to discuss budget. [cite: 100]
* Unclear decision-making process. [cite: 100]
* No definite timeline. [cite: 100]
* Disconnected from business goals. [cite: 100]

### E. Securing Decision Maker Involvement

* **Get commitment for next steps:**
    * "Would it make sense to include [decision maker] in our next conversation?" [cite: 101]
    * "I'd love to share this directly with [CEO name]. When could we make that happen?" [cite: 102]
* **Handle resistance to involving decision-makers:**
    * "I understand [decision maker] is busy. What if we prepared a focused presentation specifically addressing their key concerns?" [cite: 103]
    * "Would it help if we put together some initial numbers for you to share with them first?" [cite: 104]
* **Example Approach:** "Thanks for walking me through this. Given the scope of impact we've discussed, it would probably be valuable to include [CEO name] in our next conversation. I know they're busy - we could do a focused 30-minute session just walking through the ROI and implementation approach. What's the best way to get that scheduled?" [cite: 105]

### F. Call Wrap-up

* Summarize key points. [cite: 105]
* Confirm understanding. [cite: 105]

## 9. Rapport Building Examples

### A. Matching and Mirroring

* If client leans back with crossed legs, gradually adopt similar posture. [cite: 105]
* Match energy level and speaking pace. [cite: 105]
* Mirror hand gestures naturally. [cite: 105]
* In virtual settings, match posture and energy. [cite: 105]

### B. Personal Connection Examples

* **Wrong Approach:** Immediately jumping to business after personal anecdotes. [cite: 105]
* **Right Approach:** "That's interesting about your family business. You know, I really appreciate that because [brief personal connection]. And when it comes to the opportunity you mentioned..." [cite: 105]

## 10. Transition Phrases

* "Before we cover the next thing, are there any questions?" [cite: 106]
* "Having gone through all the technical aspects, I want to make sure everything's clear." [cite: 106]
* "I'm going to pause here - any questions on what we've covered?" [cite: 107]

## 11. Important Principles

* Stay authentic while implementing techniques. [cite: 107]
* Focus on building genuine connections. [cite: 107]
* Remember: Sales is about trust and safety. [cite: 107]
* Don't force techniques - let them flow naturally. [cite: 107]
* Focus on understanding before responding. [cite: 107]
* Always book next steps (NEVER LEAVE A CALL WITHOUT A FOLLOW UP CALL SCHEDULED). [cite: 108]
    * This massively prevents ghosting. [cite: 108]
    * It also saves a TON of time and mental load, as it negates the need to craft a convincing email to get them on a follow up call. [cite: 109]
* If they say they are not sure about scheduling the next call hit them with [previous examples in objection handling section]. [cite: 109]

## 12. Common Pitfalls & Feedback Loop

### A. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

* **Over-relying on technical expertise:** [cite: 109]
    * Don't assume technical knowledge is enough. [cite: 110]
    * Balance technical with personal connection. [cite: 110]
    * Technical trust is only half the equation. [cite: 110]
* **Missing opportunities for personal connection:** [cite: 110]
    * Avoid just saying "yeah" or "awesome" and moving on. [cite: 110]
    * Take time to acknowledge personal anecdotes. [cite: 110]
    * Find genuine ways to relate and connect. [cite: 110]
    * Use shared experiences to build rapport. [cite: 110]

### B. Feedback Loop

* Get regular feedback from peers. [cite: 110]
* **Track success metrics:**
    * Closing rates. [cite: 110]
    * Client engagement levels. [cite: 110]
    * Follow-up success rates. [cite: 110]
* Review objections received. [cite: 111]
* Adjust approach based on results. [cite: 111]
* Remember: These skills develop over time through practice. Focus on one technique at a time and build your capabilities gradually while maintaining authentic connections with prospects. [cite: 111]

## 13. The Support Role

* Be the second pair of eyes for the lead strategist. [cite: 112]
* Make sure to give confidence for the lead to focus on the prospect by being focused on all the details listed below as much as possible, keeping a quick and effective communication line on slack without spamming the chat, so the lead doesn't lose focus on the call by reading tons of text that might not help the deal move forward. [cite: 113]
* The support role should be armed with all tools possible to provide the best context support and strategic note-taking on the call. [cite: 114]
* This means smart usage of slack, perplexity, Claude prospect project, a note-taking app, sales documents, etc. [cite: 114]

### A. For the Solution Design Workshop, the support role should focus on:

* **Strategic Listening and Note-Taking:**
    * Capture both explicit and implicit needs while the lead focuses on staying present and engaged in discussion. [cite: 115]
    * Taking detailed notes, especially about pain points, priorities, and technical requirements. [cite: 116]
    * Pay special attention to personal anecdotes and emotional cues from the prospect. [cite: 117] Observe client reactions, body language, and tone. [cite: 117]
    * Are they hesitant about something? Excited about a particular feature? This subtle insight can inform the proposal. [cite: 118]
    * Document specific phrases and terminology the client uses (to mirror in the proposal). [cite: 119]
    * Make clear notes on these so the team doesn't need to rewatch the call or waste time in it. [cite: 120]
    * Also in ways that we could leverage LLMs to ingest these insights into the context to support the team when it's used. [cite: 121]
    * Track any mentioned budget constraints or timeline requirements. [cite: 121]
    * Identify, early in the game, all possible future objections by paying good attention on everything they say and how they react, also how each stakeholder on the call influences the decision maker. [cite: 122]
    * If possible, prepare the meeting recap for the lead to repeat, ensuring nothing was missed and both parties are aligned for the AE team to prepare the proposal. [cite: 122]
* **Body Language and Energy Monitoring:**
    * Watch for reactions when specific solutions or approaches are discussed. [cite: 122]
    * Notice when the prospect seems most engaged or concerned. [cite: 122]
    * Signal the lead on slack if the prospect's energy is dropping or if they seem confused, possibly suggesting an action item to it if relevant. [cite: 123]
    * The support person can use a strategic interruption support tactic to tie things back to the core value, ROI or challenge and steer the conversation back, it might even take the lead on the call as it happened on the VISA deal for example where the prospect was having a hard time to identify his challenge and it ended up building rapport with the support person. [cite: 124]
* **Question Management:**
    * Keep track of unanswered questions during technical discussions. [cite: 124] Note down areas where the prospect seemed hesitant or uncertain to clarify on the proposal or explain in the call if relevant. [cite: 125]
    * Note questions in sections above and ensure we don't miss anything. [cite: 126]
    * When appropriate, step in with targeted questions to uncover specifics the client might not have fully explained (e.g., timelines, bottlenecks, integration needs). [cite: 127]
    * Look for opportunities to ask clarifying questions when appropriate playing the supportive role freely, always focusing on the call objectives. [cite: 128]
* **Track eye-patterns:**
    * Try to observe eye patterns on early calls if at all possible, possibly checking specific moments on recording and preparing for the SDR call. [cite: 129]
    * **Watch where prospects look when answering questions about:**
        * Budget ("What's your target investment range?") [cite: 129]
        * Decision-making process ("Who else needs to be involved?") [cite: 129]
        * Timeline ("When do you need this implemented?") [cite: 129]
    * This helps identify if they're creating answers on the spot vs. recalling actual information. [cite: 129]
    * Looking up-right often indicates constructing/imagining. [cite: 129]
    * Looking up-left often indicates remembering. [cite: 129]
    * **Watch for specific patterns when discussing numbers:**
        * Looking left often indicates recalling known budgets/figures. [cite: 129]
        * Looking right might suggest they're creating/estimating numbers. [cite: 129]
        * Looking down might indicate internal calculation or discomfort. [cite: 129]
    * **Use these cues to help the lead adjust their approach:**
        * If seeing "recall" patterns: They likely have real budget numbers. [cite: 129]
        * If seeing "construction" patterns: They might need more budget justification. [cite: 129]
* **Active research:**
    * Whenever a client brings up a specific website, product, technique, or concept that is of interest to them, look it up quickly and add context on slack or be prepared to talk a bit about it later on the call. [cite: 130]
    * Can use perplexity + Claude to expand knowledge. [cite: 131]

### B. For the Solution Design Review, the support role should focus on:

* **Objection Detection:**
    * Listen and observe for early signs of potential objections. [cite: 132]
    * Note down specific concerns for later addressing. [cite: 132]
    * Or try to already add a question to slack for the lead to raise, the earlier the better. [cite: 133]
    * Be prepared to provide additional context or examples that support the lead's points, increasing depth will definitely help increase trust on the approach, on the examples and on the overall team. [cite: 134]
* **Emotional Connection:**
    * While the lead discusses technical solutions, the support can maintain the human element whenever appropriate. [cite: 135]
    * This could play really well if we had something from the intro call, or even if the person talking about tech is the support role and the lead can pull back something to connect with the rapport work done on previous calls. [cite: 136]
    * Look for opportunities to reference earlier personal connections e.g. "This reminds me of what you mentioned about your experience with [previous project/challenge]". [cite: 137]
* **Real-Time Feedback:**
    * Monitor prospect reactions to pricing and timeline discussions. [cite: 138]
    * Watch for non-verbal cues during key moments. [cite: 138]
    * Be ready to jump in with relevant examples or case studies if needed. [cite: 139]
    * Signaling the lead to pause or clarify when you notice consistent patterns of disengagement or asking a question directed to the person is a good way to bring the person back to the conversation, Jarid used this on a Hive call. [cite: 140]
* **Active research:**
    * Whenever a client brings up a specific website, product, technique, or concept that is of interest to them, look it up quickly and add context on slack or be prepared to talk a bit about it later on the call. [cite: 141]
    * Can use perplexity + Claude to expand knowledge. [cite: 141]

### C. Specific Communication Techniques

* **When the lead is deep in technical explanation, support role can ask (Tag-Team Question):**
    * Clarifying questions that other stakeholders might be thinking. [cite: 142]
    * Business impact questions to keep discussion grounded. [cite: 142]
    * ROI-focused questions that help build value. [cite: 142]
* **If energy drops during technical discussions:**
    * Share a relevant quick case study or solution examples. [cite: 142]
    * Ask an engaging question about their business if it can be related to the current moment of the call or to a specific transition. [cite: 142]
    * Help transition to a more interactive part of the discussion. [cite: 142]
* **Building Trust Through Consistency:**
    * Reference specific details from previous calls. [cite: 143]
    * Connect technical solutions back to personal anecdotes shared earlier. [cite: 143]
    * Maintain professional optimism, particularly during challenging moments. [cite: 143]
* The support role has a very special spot on the process since it is observing everything and everyone. [cite: 144]
* Being ready to jump in quickly on diverse moments will be key to making calls smoothly. [cite: 144]
* **In group meetings, track multi-stakeholder behavior when:**
    * Strategic questions are asked (identifies real decision-makers). [cite: 145]
    * Prices are mentioned (identify who controls budget). [cite: 145]
    * Technical details are discussed (who understands technical aspects). [cite: 145]
* Share these observations with the lead after the call to help target future communications. [cite: 145]
* Make sure it is added to Hubspot too. [cite: 145]

## 14. Objections, Policies and Guidelines

### Sales Process and Objection Handling

* When someone gives a price objection, there are typically two reasons: 1) They don't see the value, or 2) They don't have the budget. [cite: 146]
* When handling objections, use a curious, understanding tone. [cite: 147] Restate their objection to confirm you understand, then dig deeper to uncover the root cause. [cite: 147]
* Provide a range or estimate rather than a single fixed price. [cite: 148] This allows flexibility and shows you're being transparent. [cite: 148]
* Quantify the value and ROI upfront. [cite: 149] Tie the investment to the potential cost savings or revenue increase. [cite: 149]
* Use concrete numbers and ranges. [cite: 149]
* If they push back on price, don't immediately offer a discount. [cite: 150] Instead, explain why the value justifies the investment, or offer a payment plan at a slightly higher price. [cite: 151]
* Be prepared to walk away if they are solely focused on price and unwilling to see the value you provide. [cite: 152]

### 14.a Client bringing their own devs NOTE: Client bringing their own devs, show full project cost w/o their dev, can't guarantee timeline

* These guidelines outline our approach when clients want to bring their own developers into our projects. [cite: 153]
* This situation requires careful handling to maintain project quality while being accommodating to client preferences. [cite: 154]
* Maintain transparency about potential impacts on project timeline and quality. [cite: 154]
* Present clear cost comparisons. [cite: 154]
* Set appropriate expectations upfront. [cite: 154]
* **Cost Presentation:**
    * Present the full project cost without their developer as the baseline. [cite: 154]
    * Break down the cost difference with their developer included. [cite: 154]
    * Clearly document any assumptions made about the external developer's capabilities. [cite: 154]
    * Explicitly state that original timeline guarantees cannot be maintained. [cite: 154]
    * Establish clear quality standards and expectations upfront, documenting potential risks of integrating external developers. [cite: 154]
* **Client Communication Template:**
    * When discussing this situation with clients, use the following key messages: [cite: 155]
    * "We're happy to work with your developer, but we want to be upfront about a few important points: [cite: 155]
        * Here's the full project cost without your developer: [Insert Full Cost] [cite: 155]
        * While we're excited to collaborate, we cannot guarantee our standard timeline. [cite: 156]
        * If integration challenges arise, we may need to adjust our approach. [cite: 156]
        * We've outlined two scenarios for your consideration: [cite: 156]
            * Recommended approach with our full team. [cite: 156]
            * Alternative approach incorporating your developer." [cite: 156]
* **Remember:** The goal is to be accommodating while protecting project quality and maintaining transparent communication throughout the process. [cite: 156]

### 14b. Pricing or team objections - client wants to be cheaper with us

* Ask questions around what the client values out of this experience. [cite: 157]
* TODO: add examples from Jordan. [cite: 157]
* How important is to your budget - trust and reliability. [cite: 157]
* How important is trusting the team? [cite: 157]
* You told me you don't trust this team? [cite: 158]
* I need to understand, I want to understand. [cite: 158]
* I don't want to risk 200k dollars. [cite: 158]
* Stress the idea of the cheap model against their value. [cite: 158]
* Based on what you said, we have an option for 300k or 400k , at 300k we can do this… slower, reliability on your team is lower, we might get to a place where we might waste 2 to 4 weeks of time. [cite: 159]
* Cost of delay, Opportunity cost. [cite: 159]
* What is the opportunity cost we are wasting. [cite: 159]
* Is the risk worth the squeeze. [cite: 159]
* e.g., Excel sheet visual example - show option A and B and add reliability rates. [cite: 159]
* Pick the one you want. [cite: 159]
* We cannot commit yet, we need to vet your team. [cite: 159]

## 15.

### How to deal with client expectations when we have tight allocations:

* **Strategic Capacity Communication:**
    * Position scarcity as evidence of quality and market validation: "We're super proud that we are one of the most premier AI vendors on the marketplace, which is why we get a lot of referrals." [cite: 160]
    * Use specific language about availability: "Based on our current capacity forecast, we only have availability to bring on one more client and the tentative onboarding date is [date]." [cite: 161]
    * Create transparent urgency: "We are in conversation with X other firms. Whoever completes the retainer first will secure that open spot." [cite: 161]
    * Reinforce quality standards: "If we're going to sustain our quality standards, we do not compromise our capacity plan, which is why we're so good at delivering." [cite: 161]

* **Building Trust Through Scarcity:**
    * Use client extension narrative: "Most of our clients extend their projects because we drive tremendous value." [cite: 161]
    * Explain scheduling constraints positively: "This allows us to find the perfect resource fit for your project." [cite: 162]
    * Provide specific timelines: "The next availability after that is 4-6 weeks depending on how things shake out." [cite: 162]
    * Always end with consent-building: "Is that okay with you?" [cite: 162]

### Things to add:

* **Notes on how to get them to get materials to us:**
    * We are investing time from our senior people but also we want to respect your time in the call so this is necessary to have a great meeting. [cite: 163]
    * Be suggestive: it's really helpful if you do this, as opposed to it being a requirement. [cite: 164]
    * Be very direct and think about the minimum amount of information that we need. [cite: 165]
    * Yes or no questions are best. [cite: 165]
* Before we go in: how technical are you? [cite: 165]
* Be a GUIDE, both in the call and. [cite: 166]
* I will map out how this would look like. [cite: 166]
* Pause after recap. [cite: 166]
* Based on what you have seen today, do you feel like you understand your needs? [cite: 167]
* "How does that sound?" [cite: 167]
* 1 question at a time, you can only handle 1 objection at a time. [cite: 167]
* People make emotional decisions and then back them up with logic. [cite: 168]
* **Making people sign things and commit earlier:**
    * Hey we have this place on hold for you for next quarter. [cite: 169]
    * We just need to get a yes and sign the contract to keep that place, otherwise we will have to give it to someone else. [cite: 170]
* Remove awesome from vocabulary. "I hear you, that makes total sense" (or similar). [cite: 170]

### Start of the call:

* Rapport. [cite: 170]
* Intention. [cite: 170]
* Recap. [cite: 170]
* At the beginning of each call set up a structure. [cite: 171]
* Always say we will use the last 5 minutes to schedule the next call. [cite: 171]
* Pretend you have not seen them in 3 years. [cite: 171]
